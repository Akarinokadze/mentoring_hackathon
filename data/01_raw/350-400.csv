https://t.me/Bychkow_Dmitrii",3,"Москва, Москва, Россия",64,"There are different types of servers that play important roles in managing and distributing data across networks. 🔥 Here are some basic server types and what they do: 💡 🌐 Origin Server: This server holds the original copy of a website or web application. When you access a website, your browser sends a request to the origin server, which then sends back the necessary files to display the site on your screen.🌐 Proxy Server: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and another server. It can help improve network performance by caching frequently accessed files and web pages, as well as filtering requests for security purposes.📧 Mail Server: This type of server manages the sending and receiving of email messages. When you send an email, your email client communicates with the mail server to deliver the message to the recipient's mail server.🌐 Web Server: A web server is a software program that delivers web content, such as HTML pages and images, to web browsers. It listens for incoming requests from clients and sends back the appropriate responses.🔍 DNS Server: A DNS server translates human-readable domain names (like ""google.com"") into IP addresses that computers can understand. When you type a URL into your browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address.✅ Understanding these basic server types can help you better navigate and troubleshoot network issues.

But did you know that this module provides a wide range of mathematical functions that can help simplify your code?The Math module in JavaScript provides methods for common mathematical operations like rounding, trigonometry, logarithms, and more. These functions can be useful in a variety of applications, from simple calculations to complex data analysis.Some of the most commonly used functions include:Math.round(): rounds a number to the nearest integerMath.random(): generates a random number between 0 and 1Math.max(): returns the highest value in a set of numbersMath.min(): returns the lowest value in a set of numbersMath.abs(): returns the absolute value of a numberMath.pow(): raises a number to a specified powerMath.sqrt(): returns the square root of a numberMath.sin(): returns the sine of an angleBy using these functions, you can make your code more efficient and concise. Plus, since the Math module is built into JavaScript, you don't need to install any external libraries to use it.So if you're a JavaScript developer looking to streamline your code and make it more mathematically sound, consider exploring the Math module.To learn more do visit W3Schools.comhttps://lnkd.in/dtKfgnE7#JavaScriptProgramming #JavaScriptDevelopers #MathFunctions #MathOperations #ProgrammingTips #WebDevelopment #CodeSimplicity #DataAnalysis #SoftwareDevelopment #ProgrammingLanguages #JavaScriptCode #JavaScriptSyntax #ProgrammingSkills #CodingCommunity #LearnToCode #CodeNewbie #CodingLife #TechTalk #CodeTips #DeveloperCommunity #CodeInspiration #JavaScriptTips #WebDeveloperTips #WebDesign #TechUpdates",7,1,5

https://t.me/Bychkow_Dmitrii",3,"Москва, Москва, Россия",64,"😱 Create React App RIP??? 😱 Зайдя на официальный сайт React я не сразу понял, что произошло.Когда мы заходим на страницу документации React в раздел установки, мы можем увидеть различные предложенные варианты установки фреймворков React, а именно Next.js, Remix, Expo, Gatsby. Но при этом нет варианта установки самого React в чистом виде. Неужели React сдает позиции.На самом деле это не так. Если присмотреться, то можно найти скрытую сноску с информацией о том, можно ли использовать React в чистом виде. Ниже я представлю перевод части данной сноски.Вы определенно можете использовать React без фреймворка. Однако, если вы создаете новое приложение или сайт полностью с помощью React, мы рекомендуем использовать платформу.И вот почему.Даже если сначала вам не нужна маршрутизация или получение данных (data fetching), вы, скорее всего, потом заходите добавить необходимые для них библиотеки. По мере роста вашего Javascript приложения растет ваш код и вам придется выяснять, как разнести этот код для каждого роута по отдельности. Во время увеличения потребностей в получении данных вероятно придется столкнуться с проблемами водопадом между сервером и клиентом (server-client network waterfalls), что замедлит ваше приложение. Поскольку большинство пользователей из аудитории имеет плохие условия сетевого соединения и недорогие устройства, вам понадобится создать HTML с ранним отображением компонентов - либо на сервере, либо во время сборки. Изменение настроек для выполнения части кода на сервере или во время сборки может быть сложным.. . . . . . .Фреймворки React на этой странице решают подобные проблемы по умолчанию, без дополнительной работы с вашей стороны. Они позволяют вам начать очень экономно, а затем масштабировать ваше приложение в соответствии с вашими потребностями.. . . . . . .Если вы все еще не уверены, или ваше приложение имеет необычные ограничения, которые плохо обслуживаются этими фреймворками, и вы хотите развернуть свою собственную пользовательскую настройку, мы не можем остановить вас — дерзайте! Берите react и react-dom из npm, настраивайте свой пользовательский процесс сборки с помощью сборщика, такого как Vite или Parcel, и добавляйте другие инструменты по мере необходимости для маршрутизации, статической генерации или рендеринга на стороне сервера и многого другого.Исходя из данной информации в принципе можно понять, что с React все в порядке. Просто разработчики говорят о том, что React - это библиотека, которая не имеет множества встроенных инструментов и лучше использовать какой-либо фреймворк, но при этом никто не перестает поддерживать и использовать React.#javascript #react #html #data #network",4,,2

Я Frontend разработчик.

Я люблю новые технологии, свободное время посвящаю изучению нового стека.
Мне нравится анализировать все, что происходит вокруг меня, и обдумывать различные ветки сценариев моих действий в поиске самого эффективного решения.

Мой стек:
- Frontend: JavaScript, React, Redux Toolkit, HTML, CSS, SCSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Sequelize
- Работа с REST API, Git, Webpack, Jest, AJAX
Осваиваю: TypeScript, Prizma, Redis

Стремлюсь работать в развивающейся компании, с комфортной командой.
Для меня важно развиваться и чувствовать профессиональный рост.

There are 4 ways, no matter whether you’re using PayPal, Stripe, Paytm, WeChat, or Alipay. Is this surprising to you? To understand this, we will answer to questions. The first question is who presents the QR code:1. You can present the QR code and the merchant scans the code for payment. This is called ‘consumer-presented mode, and what the merchant does is direct debit your account.2. Obviously, the other way is that the merchant presents the QR code for you to scan to pay the due amount. This is called ‘merchant-presented mode’ and you grant the direct credit from your account.The second question is whether the QR code is dynamic or static:1. A dynamic QR code means the QR code will be generated when you present it, or it will automatically regenerate every few seconds. Because it is dynamically generated, it may contain rich information, such as the amount due, transaction type, etc.2. A static QR code is generated once and used everywhere. Usually, it only contains the account information. So there are 2*2=4 ways to scan a QR code, which are:1. Consumer-presented mode + static QR code2. Consumer-presented mode + dynamic QR code3. Merchant-presented mode + static QR code4. Merchant-presented mode + dynamic QR codeI’ve created an image to illustrate these 4 cases and their classic scenarios. 👉 Over to you: I’ve marked one of the scan-to-pay scenarios with a red alert symbol to indicate that a risk is present. Do you know why it is high risk? —Join a growing community of more than 100,000 readers who love System Design. Subscribe here: https://bit.ly/3FEGliw #systemdesign #coding #interviewtips.",8,3,1
