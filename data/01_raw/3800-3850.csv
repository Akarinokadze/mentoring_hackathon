Leadership essentials program was a great journey, or better to say part of a journey to effective, natural leadership in #EPAMAnywhere. Aside from my deepest gratitude to trainers Viktoriia Zlotnikova and Kateryna Porodko, I would like to thank all groupmates for our small community and productive time together. ❗️ Below I would like to leave a part of my take-aways:🔔 1. Each appearance, meeting or email is your reputation.🔔 2. If you were a high performer in your work before becoming a leader, you may find the journey into leadership particularly difficult.If you want to be a leader, you have to be yourself–skillfully. © Gareth Jones🔔 3. It is proven that people easily confirm something that would only appear in the future (Emily Pronin experiment - Doing Unto Future Selves As You Would Do Unto Others🔔 4. Know your values. Joharo window is a useful technique for understanding your inner nature🔔 5. Apply the knowledge about DISC model or four ears theory regularly. It may appear to be exceptionally fruitful one day. At least you would be surprised of obvious things that did not notice before 🔔 6. You are responsible not only for sending a message, but for the whole communication process you initiate (that your email is understood correctly, response is received, actions are taken etc)🔔 7. Life would be easier if you would be able to make your partner speak out results and action items at the end of the meeting🔔 8. Practice open questions🔔 9. Trust your team, evolve, engage, motivate! Spend time on motivation map/profile 🔔 10. Uncertainty is always a signal to re-think the situation. Always try to reduce VUCA by asking questions and assessing situations from different angles. Always remember about Global mindset🔔 11. Try to confirm that your vision matches the client`s one. No rush!🔔 12. Check if group need>have a moderator, delegate smartly (""move monkeys from your shoulders"")🔔 13. Focus on the goal, not the rules.🔔 14. Situational leadership may be useful if you know when and how to apply it. Practice makes you perfect🔔 15. Make small talks more personal. ""How are you"" is ok, but does not always work as expected🔔 16. Go out of your comfort zone - it would teach you more effectively, fast and long-term🔔 17. Look out for communication/leadership/conflict resolution styles and patterns in movies, series or just during morning coffee in the nearest bakery. Learn from everyone 🔔 18. Even if your idea is perfect to you, test it with real stakeholders and be open to changesThanks to EPAM Anywhere for the opportunity 🎓It was not always easy to allocate time and stay focused, however, it was really worth it.",3,,

Weinberg, 2008In an easy and relaxed way, the author explains one of the main fallacies in QA.Dev team may assume that their intent is the same as the requirements. But can we really be sure that their understanding of requirements was correct at the moment they did implementation? We have no way of finding out, other than QA to test against it. But what dev team can and should do is to verify that their intent corresponds to the implementation. And only if both dev and QA do testing, we will know that there are no discrepancies between Intent, Implementation, and Requirements. Otherwise, we`re setting ourselves up for a fall later.What do you think? How is it going on your project? Which level of dev testing is enough? Share your opinion :)#WednesdayQAPoll",3,,1

Whittaker ""Exploratory Software Testing: Tips, Tricks, Tours, and Techniques to Guide Test Design"", 2009Most of us are looking for some unique recipe for success, a recipe for happiness, or spectacular career prospects. Below is one of the recipes for QA career or, even, the purpose of it. Working as a QA Lead on several projects, I can agree with the author that part of our job is to find shortcomings and weaknesses not only in code itself, but also in processes, nay, customer expectations.❓ Does it echo with your personal attitude? Or the focus should be concentrated on the system only?",8,,

          …См. еще",10,Украина,102,"#BookInsights #QA      The best way to learn smth is to initiate a discussion on new information. Well, let's try and see if conversation would arise one day :)📚 James A. Whittaker ""Exploratory Software Testing: Tips, Tricks, Tours, and Techniques to Guide Test Design"", 2009      The author argues that some bugs can be found only by real end-users, comparing testing with homeownership. Saing, for example, that you don`t know how good is your septic system till several hour-long showers. Hmm, I hope my contractor will be able to predict the necessary system characteristics based on my family size, right? Same with other cases. However, obvious logic of the above idea is clear: we cannot be 100% sure that users will follow scenarios we covered. More than 10 years passed since the book was published, dozens of new test tools entered the market. Didn`t we really get a chance to predict system and user behavior to enough extent? I believe that at least a percentage of such tricky uncovered issues is decreasing year by year. Meaning, the issues that QA team was not able to identify earlier because of fair reasons. And probably the most significant impact on this enhancement does AI and Big Data (Predictive Analysis) development.What do you think❓",5,1,
