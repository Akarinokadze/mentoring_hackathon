В нашей команде никогда не было конкуренции, мы всегда были взаимозаменямы, вели общие лонг-листы, вместе общались с Заказчиками, вместе принимали решения, поэтому решили, что в этом наша сила. Мы всегда шутили, что мы друг для друга – команда мечты, поэтому над названием не пришлось долго думать 😉- Мы очень любим то, чем занимаемся и не считаем это «работой», нам просто нравится помогать хорошим компаниям и специалистам найти друг друга.- Мы за честность и открытость в работе, поэтому некоторые Заказчики и кандидаты стали нашими добрыми друзьями.Итак, 1 сентября 2019 года родилось наше маленькое, но гордое рекрутинговое агентство DreamTeam.Более подробно о нас можно прочесть здесь: https://lnkd.in/gCp8JjmЗа это время у нас появилось 7 заказчиков и мы закрыли 15 вакансий IT специалистов.

Если ситуация не в вашу пользу, то имеет смысл рассмотреть переход✅ Взять дополнительный проект или задачиЕсли на текущем нет такой возможности, то можно в свободное время выполнять интересные для вас задачи: например, стать консультантом/наставником для новичков в вашей сфере или преподавателем в онлайн-школе✅ Рассмотреть смежную роль/функциюРассмотрите смежное направление, которое более щедро оплачивается. Например, для HR при переходе в ИТ уровень зарплаты увеличится минимум в 2 раза✅ Релокация Классика: переезд из регионов в столицу, либо удаленная работа в крупных городах также увеличат зарплату в 1,5-2 разаЕсли вы хотите увеличить зарплату, но самостоятельно не получается, приглашаю на карьерную консультацию, пишите в лс.#hr #зарплата #карьерныйконсультант",2,2,

О том, что вы ищите себе работу, важно рассказывать в соцсетях, знакомым и бывшим коллегам, помним про правило “7 рукопожатий”.4) Не надеемся только на сайты для поиска работы, подключаем другие каналы поиска.5) Правильно упаковываем резюме под новую профессию.

За подробностями пишите в тг @avalsorai",4,Агломерация Санкт-Петербурга,14,"5 лайфхаков, как отвечать на вопросы, чтобы пройти первичное собеседование1: Отвечайте прямо.Рекрутеру/hr нужно понять, что вы умеете прямо отвечать на поставленные вопросы. Поэтому не уходите от ответов в сторону, не стоит рассказывать про свои достижения, когда вопрос был про зарплатные ожидания.2: Умейте слушать. Не надо рассказывать про всю жизнь) Возможно рекрутер попросит вас рассказать вкратце про последние 2 места работы, так как время интервью ограничено. Или подробнее про ваши достижения. Умейте слушать, или спросите в каком ключе лучше построить беседу.3: Будьте честными. Иногда в резюме кандидаты скрывают какое-то место работы, например, потому что  проработали там всего 2-3 месяца. Лучше будьте честными и расскажите об этом на интервью рекрутеру, так как  в случае оффера и оформления этот вопрос все равно всплывет и будет не очень красиво.4. Покажите свою мотивацию.Один из моих любимых вопросов: я прошу назвать 3 критерия выбора новой работы, это помогает понять мне мотивацию кандидата. Будет странно, если у вас в приоритете удаленка, а вы общаетесь по вакансии в офис. Поэтому составьте заранее список критериев выбора нового места, этот чек-лист вам еще пригодится для выбора между офферами. 5. Анализируйте.Иногда можно встретить странные или неудобные вопросы, например, про семейное положение или наличие детей. Тут важно отнестись к этому с юмором, в крайнем случае на них можно и не отвечать. А после интервью взвесить все плюсы и минусы этой вакансии. Если они не критичны для вас и явных плюсов больше, то можно смело продолжить общение. А если вас трясет от каких-то вопросов, то идите смело на другое собеседование) На самом деле есть 5-7 базовых вопросов, которые повторяются на большинстве первичных интервью. Это могут быть вопросы: “Почему вы решили уйти с последнего места работы?”, “Почему мы должны нанять именно вас?”или “Какие у вас зарплатные ожидания?”. И вы будете увереннее себя чувствовать, если заранее продумаете ответы и подготовитесьЕсли вы испытываете сейчас сложности с прохождением интервью, нет обратной связи после, то приглашаю вас на индивидуальную консультацию по подготовке к собеседованиям. На ней мы потренируем вашу самопрезентацию с достижениями (а они есть у каждого) и разберем, как же грамотно отвечать базовые вопросы, чтобы успешно проходить собеседования.В результате вам будет по плечу 80-90 % первичных интервью, в том числе можем подготовиться под конкретные вакансии.Пишите в лс, кому актуально.",2,,

Выберите минимум 2-3 канала по приоритетности - Очень классно работает нетворкинг: спросите у друзей, выложите пост в соцсетях, напишите знакомым hr/рекрутерам- Заявите о себе ярко: упакуйте резюме, вставьте ключевые слова (по которым рекрутеры вас легко найдут), сделайте портретное фото, подготовьте самопрезентацию. Сейчас на рынке конкуренция высока, поэтому важно выделиться, чтобы вас заметили и пригласили на интервью.- Если подходящих вакансий мало: можно в холодную разослать свое резюме в кадровые агентства или компании, которые вам нравятся. Тут важно писать сопроводительные письма, указывать вашу мотивацию.

Да, в компании написано много кода, работает множество сервисов, но нам не нужно в них залезать. Если нам и нужно что-то использовать, то мы обращаемся с ними по API, общаемся с командой, которая их делает.2. Kubernetes. Инфраструктура есть и работает в проде.3. Remote First.
