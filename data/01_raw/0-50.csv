It could be fiction or nonfiction.Tip 2 - Once you find what to read define where and when to read Ex - I like to read after dinner everyday in the study room for 15-30 minutes.Tip 3 - Try to maintain a tracker where you can cross or mark your everyday progress. It will gives you the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.Tip 4 - Do not try to complete the book if it does not excite you even after 50 pages, Because it's not only your responsibility to finish the book, the book itself has to be interesting so that we can complete it. Bonus Tip - Make it easy and obvious do not try to finish a book a day just start small 5-10 pages a day and if someday you haven't get time to read then don't feel guilty it's okay to miss somedays.#habitbuilding #readerscommunity #bookreader #learningeveryday #growingeveryday",2,3,1

Заполнить профиль в линке, откликаться на hh и параллельно узучать новое, как я делал раньше, это слишком пассивный вариант. Нужно ломиться в каждую открытую и не очень дверь, заявлять о себе рекрутерам, по возможности знакомится с людьми со схожей деятельностью. В этой жизни засчитываются только действия, а не просто твои хотелки, которые так и могут остаться у тебя в голове без должной реализации. Как раз этот пост я и считаю тем самым ""Действием"", хоть и небольшим. Наверно многие кто составлял пост о поиске работы предварительно гуглил как ""Правильно"" это делать: причина поиска, чем будешь полезен, цели, навыки и куча бессмысленных смайликов 🔥. Я даже просил ChatGPT составить пост о поиске работы. По итогу решил отказаться от советов шаблонного написания и от ChatGPT. Возможно я неправильно и непрофессионально заявляю о себе, за то сам.

Architectural patterns make it easier to solve these issues by providing repeatable designs that address common situations.An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture. Architectural patterns are similar to software design patterns but have a broader scope.Here are the most common architectural patterns:𝟭. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗛𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Used to optimize webpage loading time by storing static content separately from dynamic content𝟮. 𝗣𝗲𝗲𝗿-𝘁𝗼-𝗣𝗲𝗲𝗿: Involves multiple components called Peers, where a pear may function both as a client, requesting services from other peers, and as a server, providing services to other peers.𝟯. 𝗣𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗿-𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿: Used to send (publishes) relevant messages to places that have subscribed to a topic.𝟰. 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 – Used to partition data in a database to speed commands or queries.𝟱. 𝗖𝗶𝗿𝗰𝘂𝗶𝘁 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿: Helps make systems more fault tolerant by minimizing the effects of a hazard by rerouting traffic to another service.𝟲. 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻: Generally used to develop applications that include groups of subtasks that execute in a specific order.𝟳. 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿: A peer-to-peer architecture that is comprised of a client, which requests a service, and a server, which provides the service.𝟴. 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿-𝗦𝗹𝗮𝘃𝗲: Consists of two components; the master distributes the work among identical slaves and computes a final result from the results which the slaves return.𝟵. 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲-𝗙𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿: Used to structure systems that produce and process a stream of data.𝟭𝟬. 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻: Uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.𝟭𝟭. 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹-𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄-𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: Divides an application into three components. The model contains the application's data and main functionality; the view displays data and interacts with the user; and the controller handles user input and acts as the mediator between the model and the view.𝟭𝟮. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿: Used to interpret a higher level language to a lower level language to execute a series of commands directly.𝟭𝟯. 𝗠𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀: Used to create multiple services that work interdependently to create a larger application.𝟭𝟰. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗦𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Used to separate read and write activities to provide greater stability, scalability, and performance.Ref:✅Grokking the System Design Interview: https://lnkd.in/g4Wii9r7✅Grokking the Advanced System Design Interview: https://lnkd.in/dyCRtiec",9,9,7
