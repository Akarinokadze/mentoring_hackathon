It lets you to set up your custom AI tutor, adjust the depth of knowledge, teaching style and reasoning framework to match your learning needs. Instructions:1. Open ChatGPT2. Choose GPT-4 (or higher)3. Copy/paste the prompt from the GitHub repo below4. Let the AI help you set everything up5. Start learning and have fun!I love this approach. Setting the context in JSON format is amazing (I didn't even know that was possible!). It's super easy to customize. One thing I‚Äôd change:Tie the AI tutor to a RAG architecture (see my last newsletter: https://lnkd.in/ezk5ch32) so it only uses trusted knowledge sources I give it (like books, etc).Really cool stuff.

Be efficient.5) Ditch frequent meetingsThere‚Äôs no better way to waste everyone‚Äôs time.Use meetings to:- Collaborate- Attack issues head-on- Solve urgent problemsBut once you resolve the issue, frequent meetings are no longer necessary.You can resolve most issues without a meeting.Instead of meetings:- Send a text- Send an email- Communicate on a discord or slack channelDon‚Äôt interrupt your team‚Äôs workflow if it‚Äôs unnecessary.6) Use common senseIf a company rule doesn‚Äôt:- Make sense- Contribute to progress- Apply to your specific situationAvoid following the rule with your eyes closed.Don‚Äôt follow rules.
