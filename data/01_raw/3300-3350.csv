Kickico project was hacked on July 27, to be precise owning key of KICK coin smart contract was stolen and some tokens were burnt. Kickico project recovered access and promises to restore stolen/burnt tokens. Interesting token contract and very lucky guys. Really interesting thing starts next. Exmo.me crypto exchange also suffered a loss of KICK coins. And they started to lay their hands on KICK deposits which were sent *after* the hack, i.e. on coins which were perfectly safe. The scheme is the following: you send deposit, it is confirmed in Ethereum network, but you won't see it in your exmo wallet. Support is making excuses about technical maintenance (10 days of maintenance? C'mon), but I know that tokens were safe before transacting to exmo and don't need any maintenance. The likely root of the issue is that they're trying to cover (maybe temporal) expenses at the expense of users.The bottom line is that if you're using exmo - consider more trusted exchange, otherwise you're exposing yourself to a high risk of theft or funds blocking.#blockchain #scam #exmo",,,

As a person who needs to visualize anything to understand it better, I keep touching different user-facing technologies. Currently, after leading a development team in mobile apps first startup for a year and a half and gaining much experience in mobile development, I am solely developing my simple board game-themed iOS utility in Swift. Later, I have plans to reimplement it as a Progressive Web App too. Also, my Xamleeg project needs a visual and feature update for a long time.

Apart from my desire to learn, I eager to help people, to teach them, share my experience, provide my opinion, if needed. During my university years, I assisted my professor in conducting practical seminars. I was willing to stay as a teacher after graduating from the university, but due to budget cuts, our department could not offer me any position at that moment.

So, now I am looking for a job where I can learn from people that are smarter than me, try new technologies and languages with them, build new great things together and share my experience with people afterward.",8,"Москва, Московская область, Россия",7,,,,
