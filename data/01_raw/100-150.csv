It is ipmortant to pay attention to like and write comments below these posts because it affects your SSI score. Use hashtags (especially #linkedin) in each message.4. Created my own posts. It is simple and last, but not the least. Whether I have any sort of a curious article or I want to share my current SSI, I make a post on my page and show/share it with my network. It is establishing of my brand here. I do all these things daily and it became as a routine.

          …См. еще",2,Россия,4,"Уже вчера я получил наконец свою электронную версию документа о профессиональной переподготовке от Яндекс.Практикум по курсу Веб-разработчик Плюс. Позади 18 месяцев учебы. Я уже работаю по новой специальности как фронтенд разработчик в небольшом стартапе. После 3 месяцев учебы я уже писал отзыв о курсе, но полагаю все же будет честным написать еще один отзыв по завершению, так как теперь представляю картину в целом. Немного вводных. Я с детства увлекаюсь компьютерами, но высшее образование в свое время получил по специальности Юриспруденция. Был юристом более 8 лет, сопровождал строительные проекты. Участвовал и в довольно крупных проектах. Поэтому, хоть и был уверенным пользователем компьютера, но с программированием был знаком на уровне школьной программы, где нас когда-то давно учили программировать на Turbo Pascal. Решил сменить свой профиль по причине того, что выгорел на своей работе, видя, что мой труд является формальным и никому не нужен. Почему выбрал Практикум? Потому что они обещали отчислить, если вовремя не буду сдавать работы. У меня к этому довольно специфичное отношение, я очень часто вижу вокруг людей, которые считают, что им обязаны. Я сегодня пришел в офис - вы обязаны мне платить (и не важно, что ты сидишь весь день в телефоне и не работаешь), я пришел в университет - вы обязаны дать мне диплом о высшем образовании (и не важно, что ты еще в первый день первого курса забил болт на учебу), я оплатил курс - вы обязаны устроить меня в IT, где я буду получать трилиард рублей в наносекунду попивая смузи на пляжах Бали. Категорически не считаю такую позицию правильной. Более того, потакание такой позиции ради наживы и выгоды, губит систему образование как таковую. Можно было допустить, что Практикум написал это в целях рекламы, но, во-первых, мне кажется это скорее антиреклама, а во-вторых у меня есть цифры моего потока. 7-я когорта в октябре 2021 года стартовала в составе 75 человек (+/- пара человек, но по-моему это были люди из команды сопровождения). Вчера выпустилось всего 15 человек. Это с учётом того, что на протяжении всего периода обучения к  нам переводились студенты со старших потоков, которые уходили в академ. Поэтому можете сами посчитать процент выживания на курсе. Из этого следует вторая особенность данного курса - много сложного материала и много практических работ. Вам точно не хватит 2-3 часов в неделю на прохождение курса. Минимум 4 часа ежедневной работы. Поэтому если у вас ограничено время - курс вам не подойдет. Я хочу искренне выразить признательность своей жене за терпение. Иногда казалось, что она готова выгнать меня из дома, потому что приходилось много времени тратить не на семью, а на учебу. Но при этом, материала, который дает курс не достаточно что бы с хода залететь разработчиком в Яндекс или Сбер. Объясняется это довольно просто. В качестве конкурентов у вас будут выпускники технических вузов, которые 11 лет изучали математику, программирование, потом еще 5-6 лет в вузе... Продолжение в комменте",7,1,

Consider using Redux!Redux is a state management library that can help simplify and organize your application's state. It works seamlessly with React, allowing you to easily connect your components to your state and update it as needed.With Redux, you can centralize your state and easily share it between components. This means that you can avoid passing props down through multiple layers of components and instead access your state from anywhere in your application.Redux also offers powerful tools for debugging and tracking state changes, making it easier to find and fix issues in your code.So if you're looking for a way to simplify state management in your React application, consider giving Redux a try!#Redux #ReactRedux #StateManagement #WebDevelopment #FrontEndDevelopment #JavaScript #Programming #Developer #SoftwareDevelopment #FrontEnd #BackEnd #SinglePageApplication #SPA #AppDevelopment #Code #CodingCommunity #TechTalks #CodeNewbie #ReduxStore #ReactNative",6,5,5
