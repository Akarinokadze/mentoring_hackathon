https://t.me/Bychkow_Dmitrii",3,"Москва, Москва, Россия",64,"There are different types of servers that play important roles in managing and distributing data across networks. 🔥 Here are some basic server types and what they do: 💡 🌐 Origin Server: This server holds the original copy of a website or web application. When you access a website, your browser sends a request to the origin server, which then sends back the necessary files to display the site on your screen.🌐 Proxy Server: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and another server. It can help improve network performance by caching frequently accessed files and web pages, as well as filtering requests for security purposes.📧 Mail Server: This type of server manages the sending and receiving of email messages. When you send an email, your email client communicates with the mail server to deliver the message to the recipient's mail server.🌐 Web Server: A web server is a software program that delivers web content, such as HTML pages and images, to web browsers. It listens for incoming requests from clients and sends back the appropriate responses.🔍 DNS Server: A DNS server translates human-readable domain names (like ""google.com"") into IP addresses that computers can understand. When you type a URL into your browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address.✅ Understanding these basic server types can help you better navigate and troubleshoot network issues.

But did you know that this module provides a wide range of mathematical functions that can help simplify your code?The Math module in JavaScript provides methods for common mathematical operations like rounding, trigonometry, logarithms, and more. These functions can be useful in a variety of applications, from simple calculations to complex data analysis.Some of the most commonly used functions include:Math.round(): rounds a number to the nearest integerMath.random(): generates a random number between 0 and 1Math.max(): returns the highest value in a set of numbersMath.min(): returns the lowest value in a set of numbersMath.abs(): returns the absolute value of a numberMath.pow(): raises a number to a specified powerMath.sqrt(): returns the square root of a numberMath.sin(): returns the sine of an angleBy using these functions, you can make your code more efficient and concise. Plus, since the Math module is built into JavaScript, you don't need to install any external libraries to use it.So if you're a JavaScript developer looking to streamline your code and make it more mathematically sound, consider exploring the Math module.To learn more do visit W3Schools.comhttps://lnkd.in/dtKfgnE7#JavaScriptProgramming #JavaScriptDevelopers #MathFunctions #MathOperations #ProgrammingTips #WebDevelopment #CodeSimplicity #DataAnalysis #SoftwareDevelopment #ProgrammingLanguages #JavaScriptCode #JavaScriptSyntax #ProgrammingSkills #CodingCommunity #LearnToCode #CodeNewbie #CodingLife #TechTalk #CodeTips #DeveloperCommunity #CodeInspiration #JavaScriptTips #WebDeveloperTips #WebDesign #TechUpdates",7,1,5

https://t.me/Bychkow_Dmitrii",3,"Москва, Москва, Россия",64,"😱 Create React App RIP??? 😱 Зайдя на официальный сайт React я не сразу понял, что произошло.Когда мы заходим на страницу документации React в раздел установки, мы можем увидеть различные предложенные варианты установки фреймворков React, а именно Next.js, Remix, Expo, Gatsby. Но при этом нет варианта установки самого React в чистом виде. Неужели React сдает позиции.На самом деле это не так. Если присмотреться, то можно найти скрытую сноску с информацией о том, можно ли использовать React в чистом виде. Ниже я представлю перевод части данной сноски.Вы определенно можете использовать React без фреймворка. Однако, если вы создаете новое приложение или сайт полностью с помощью React, мы рекомендуем использовать платформу.И вот почему.Даже если сначала вам не нужна маршрутизация или получение данных (data fetching), вы, скорее всего, потом заходите добавить необходимые для них библиотеки. По мере роста вашего Javascript приложения растет ваш код и вам придется выяснять, как разнести этот код для каждого роута по отдельности. Во время увеличения потребностей в получении данных вероятно придется столкнуться с проблемами водопадом между сервером и клиентом (server-client network waterfalls), что замедлит ваше приложение. Поскольку большинство пользователей из аудитории имеет плохие условия сетевого соединения и недорогие устройства, вам понадобится создать HTML с ранним отображением компонентов - либо на сервере, либо во время сборки. Изменение настроек для выполнения части кода на сервере или во время сборки может быть сложным.. . . . . . .Фреймворки React на этой странице решают подобные проблемы по умолчанию, без дополнительной работы с вашей стороны. Они позволяют вам начать очень экономно, а затем масштабировать ваше приложение в соответствии с вашими потребностями.. . . . . . .Если вы все еще не уверены, или ваше приложение имеет необычные ограничения, которые плохо обслуживаются этими фреймворками, и вы хотите развернуть свою собственную пользовательскую настройку, мы не можем остановить вас — дерзайте! Берите react и react-dom из npm, настраивайте свой пользовательский процесс сборки с помощью сборщика, такого как Vite или Parcel, и добавляйте другие инструменты по мере необходимости для маршрутизации, статической генерации или рендеринга на стороне сервера и многого другого.Исходя из данной информации в принципе можно понять, что с React все в порядке. Просто разработчики говорят о том, что React - это библиотека, которая не имеет множества встроенных инструментов и лучше использовать какой-либо фреймворк, но при этом никто не перестает поддерживать и использовать React.#javascript #react #html #data #network",4,,2

Мне нравится анализировать все, что происходит вокруг меня, и обдумывать различные ветки сценариев моих действий в поиске самого эффективного решения.

Мой стек:
- Frontend: JavaScript, React, Redux Toolkit, HTML, CSS, SCSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Sequelize
- Работа с REST API, Git, Webpack, Jest, AJAX
Осваиваю: TypeScript, Prizma, Redis

Стремлюсь работать в развивающейся компании, с комфортной командой.
Для меня важно развиваться и чувствовать профессиональный рост.

There are 4 ways, no matter whether you’re using PayPal, Stripe, Paytm, WeChat, or Alipay. Is this surprising to you? To understand this, we will answer to questions. The first question is who presents the QR code:1. You can present the QR code and the merchant scans the code for payment. This is called ‘consumer-presented mode, and what the merchant does is direct debit your account.2. Obviously, the other way is that the merchant presents the QR code for you to scan to pay the due amount. This is called ‘merchant-presented mode’ and you grant the direct credit from your account.The second question is whether the QR code is dynamic or static:1. A dynamic QR code means the QR code will be generated when you present it, or it will automatically regenerate every few seconds. Because it is dynamically generated, it may contain rich information, such as the amount due, transaction type, etc.2. A static QR code is generated once and used everywhere. Usually, it only contains the account information. So there are 2*2=4 ways to scan a QR code, which are:1. Consumer-presented mode + static QR code2. Consumer-presented mode + dynamic QR code3. Merchant-presented mode + static QR code4. Merchant-presented mode + dynamic QR codeI’ve created an image to illustrate these 4 cases and their classic scenarios. 👉 Over to you: I’ve marked one of the scan-to-pay scenarios with a red alert symbol to indicate that a risk is present. Do you know why it is high risk? —Join a growing community of more than 100,000 readers who love System Design. Subscribe here: https://bit.ly/3FEGliw #systemdesign #coding #interviewtips.",8,3,1

Learn some skills for funSome skills like 👇√ Cooking √ Sharpening knives and axes√ Driving √ Swimming √ Sewing √ Calculated silence They may not be for monetary purposes but you should learn them4. Learn Self-defence Self-defense is important.Not because you can fight anyone. But for yourself, family and moments you can't avoid.You also become more confident and disciplined.5. Always tell the truth or stay calm.Because there is nothing as shameful as being known as a liarYou may get what you want But it won't last longNo one will ever believe you when it matters6.

Я ищу постоянную работу уже почти 5 месяцев и дела в этом плане продвигаются очень медленно. За это время я научилась составлять резюме, писать сопроводительные, освоила Unittest, Arsenic, Flask, MongoDB, Docker и Linux, стала гораздо сильнее как программист и начала брать заказы на фрилансе (небольшие, но какие давали).Почему это стало так важно именно сейчас? Мои сбережения подходят к концу, а от моего дохода завишу не только я, но и моих близких человека 3 человека, 2 из которых не могут работать из-за возраста и проблем со здоровьем.Что я умею и могу?Пишу на языке программирования Python, работаю в основном с SQL базами данных и фреймворком Django, но так же знаю и MongoDB и Flask. Сейчас, в основном специализируюсь на разработке Web приложений.Умею парсить с помощью BS4 (обычный/асинхронный), Selenium и Arsenic (асинхронный вариант Selenium).Умею писать ботов для Telegram.Знаю контейнеризацию Docker и как прокладывать сети на Linux.Освоила тестирование с помощью Unittest и TestCaseЧто я ищу?Постоянную работу в Минске или удаленно, или длительный фриланс заказ. Я пунктуальна, исполнительна, поддерживаю связь с заказчиком и регулярно даю информацию по проекту, а так же не пропадаю из контактов и не игнорирую сообщения. Изучаю деплой, английский на стыке A2/B1 сейчас активно развиваю разговорный английский, что бы довести его до уровня B1.CV на русском: https://lnkd.in/eUpcWDdxЕсли у вас есть для меня предложение, прошу написать в личные сообщения или через контакты из CV.

Более сотни откликов на вакансии и полная тишина в ответ. За это время я выполнил только два тестовых задания и даже по ним, к сожалению, не получил обратной связи. Чтобы зря время не терять, я решил поучаствовать в спринт-марафоне по frontend от Clevertec. Темой проекта стало создание онлайн-библиотеки, это по сути аналог классических библиотечных формуляров, т.е. позволяет ознакомиться со всем списком доступных книг, забронировать понравившуюся книгу или отследить, когда наоборот освободится бронь по книге.Пока подводить итоги рано (еще не дошли до середины пути), но с того момента как дали API (первых два этапа больше касались верстки по макету из Figma), какой-то промежуточный результат показать уже могу. На текущий момент стек - React, Redux, React Router, RTK Query, HTML, CSS, SwiperПо факту руки я не опускаю )))) Спасибо всем за поддержку!!! )))) Поиски dreamteam продолжаются!!! )))#frontend #react #html #css",7,7,6

Можно в Telegram еще: https://t.me/sptmruНахожусь не в России, если это важно. Готов выходить практически моментально.

Он основан на искусственном интеллекте и использует машинное обучение, чтобы предлагать подсказки и автозаполнение кода на основе контекста и задачи, которую разработчик пытается решить.Одним из ключевых отличий между Copilot и ChatGPT является то, что Copilot специализируется на работе с кодом, в то время как ChatGPT разработан для ответа на разнообразные вопросы и задачи, включая общение с людьми на естественном языке.Кроме того, Copilot использует модель обучения с подкреплением, чтобы автоматически уточнять свои предложения и учитывать обратную связь от разработчика. ChatGPT, с другой стороны, использует модель языкового моделирования для генерации текстовых ответов.Copilot также обладает способностью к контекстному пониманию и может использовать контекст кода, чтобы предлагать более точные предложения и подсказки для написания нового кода.В целом, Copilot облегчает жизнь разработчиков, ускоряя процесс написания кода и помогая избежать ошибок, что в конечном итоге увеличивает производительность и эффективность.ChatGPT в качестве языковой модели также может использоваться для рефакторинга больших блоков кода. Например, он может помочь разработчикам переписать сложный блок кода более эффективным способом или найти оптимальное решение для определенной задачи.#copilot #chatgpt",3,,

https://portfolio-cv-eight.vercel.app/",2,"Калуга, Калужская область, Россия",3,"Vite - это инструмент сборки (bundler) для веб-разработки, который был создан, чтобы облегчить и ускорить процесс разработки веб-приложений. Vite - это сокращение от французского слова ""vite"" (что означает ""быстро"" или ""быстрый""), что отражает основную философию этого инструмента.Одной из основных особенностей Vite является его скорость. Он быстро пересобирает приложение и быстро отображает изменения в браузере благодаря сборке на лету (on-demand compilation) и кэшированию результатов. В результате разработчики могут быстро прототипировать свои приложения и получить быструю обратную связь на этапе разработки.Одна из других ключевых особенностей Vite - это его поддержка для модулей ES6, что позволяет разработчикам использовать современные возможности языка JavaScript без необходимости использовать сборщики типа Babel для транспиляции кода в более старые версии языка.Vite также предоставляет возможность использовать различные языки и фреймворки, такие как Vue, React и другие.По сравнению с Webpack, Vite является более легковесным и быстрым. Vite использует более простую и интуитивную конфигурацию, что упрощает процесс настройки и использования. Однако, Webpack более гибок и имеет больший набор функциональности, что делает его более подходящим для более сложных проектов.По сравнению с Gulp, Vite - это не просто задачник (task runner), а полноценный инструмент сборки (bundler), который позволяет собирать и объединять модули и зависимости вашего приложения в один файл. Gulp не является бандлером, а скорее предназначен для автоматизации процесса сборки проектов, таких как компиляция препроцессоров CSS и минификация файлов.В целом, Vite является быстрым и интуитивно понятным инструментом сборки, который лучше подходит для простых и средних проектов. Он обеспечивает быстрое время сборки, поддержку современных языков и фреймворков, а также простую и понятную конфигурацию.#vite #webpack #gulp",1,,

New loss function.Online advertising , Real time bidding.In general there are two task in real time bidding.First is a task of optimizing requests choice, second is a optimizing bid prices.A first task answers on a question , what need to buy, to get a revenue.The revenue is get from the target events: Clicks, Conversions …So we may make a model that predict the events. It’s a classification task and may be solve as usual classification problem of binary classification.A second task answers on a question , what price need, to get a more benefit and win an auction .I consider the second task.The second is more complex, need increase number of win bids. Because only a wining bid gives revenue.The trivial solution is to set a bid price little smaller then an expected benefit, for example smaller by 10 % . But this solution is not optimal when there is a limit of our budget, and limits our benefit with 10%.Not bad solution is predict a probability of win and if the probability smaller then a given value increase a bid price. It’s a classification task too.But there is another way. Lets try to find an optimal price of the bid that layers between the loss price and win price, said for the same requests. And then if the win probability for this bid price smaller then some value, we increase the bid price.At first glance, this is a regression problem. But there is one problem. We only know the cost of losing when we lose the auction, but we don't know the next win price. In another case, we know the winning price when we won the auction, but we do not know the price of the next loss.And in general the bid price is a function of an input request. That is a set of categorical and numerical values.Such as : exchange id, app id, city, hour, day of week, language , and so on.Our model need to predict an optimal price for each request.My approach is to use a custom loss function that solves the problem. (I called loss YuLoss.)The loss function is based with MSE loss with little changes, or may base with any other regression loss.The main idea is :If the prediction price less or equivale then the loss price we penalty our model.If the prediction price more then the loss price we don’t penalty our model with MSE loss.If the prediction price less or equavile then the win price we don’t penalty our model.If the prediction price more then the win price we penalty our model with MSE loss.MSE (target, prediction) , if prediction <= target and result == no win else 0YuLoss =MSE (target, prediction), if prediction > target and result == win else 0The Model was made with using Catboost lib:Inputs: a list of vectors of categorical features.Targets : a list of prices and results - win/ no win.Data set of 10 M rows.The solution has given the optimal prices that in sum less then initial prices on 70 %.By the way a win rate decrease only 5%.The experiment was made with A\ B test.",1,,

For me, description models like classification/segmentation/embedding ones seem fine.But the CLIP model is also descriptive, you can't reproduce images easily from this. SD used a pre-trained and freezed CLIP model, and CLIP itself seems as fair use.But even if you use just CLIP and optimize in pixel space you may reproduce Getty watermark or some artist style (vqvae+clip or disco diffusion or even old deep dream algo). And SD itself generates some styles not only because it used them during the training, but also because CLIP pretraining knows them already. So if CLIP is also not fair use we should start suing OpenAI.But CLIP is a ""descriptive"" model, so should we change the ""fair use"" of other descriptive models (like classification/segmentation/etc.), and how we can prove that smth was used and that model in pipeline influence someones ""style"" (CLIP or SD)?So no we can either ban all the ""fair use"" or not change it at all.",,,

Такие посты в ленте напомнили несколько случаев запущенной агорафобии, которые наблюдал ещё с тех времен, когда дистанционная работа не была мэнстримом. В трёх случаях из четырёх она постепенно развивалась от точки относительного благополучия. Кто-то был уволен с небольшим ""серебряным парашютиком"", кто-то получил скромное наследство, у кого-то была план расширения квартиры и продав большую жилплощадь он дожидался более удачной конъюнктуры съехав в маленькую квартирку или родителям. Эти 3/4 были характерны только для наблюдавшихся мужчин, женщины впадали в такое состояние после глубокой психологической травмы или болезни. Из всех женщин в моём окружении был только один случай, когда ситуация дошла до полного краха личности, через прогрессирующую психосоматику и манипулирование вторичной выгодой.   Поэтому дальше я говорю только о мужчинах. Первый шаг к разрушению был в сознательном отказе от текущей работы или специальности. Небольшие деньги позволяли выскочить из ежедневной гонки, уволится с места ради ""новой карьерной возможности"" или ""поиска себя"". На втором шаге происходило обеднении социальных связей. ""Выскочившие"" не были ни алкоголиками, ни наркоманами, у них не было ни каких увлечений или хобби, они никогда не занимались профессиональным спортом, кто-то даже самохарактеризовало себя как ""нарцисcических социофобов"". Поэтому у них абсолютно не было опыта ""вне рабочих"" коммуникаций. Они тихо сидели дома, читали книги, строили какие-то планы и занимались домашними делами, постепенно переставая думать о том, как они выглядят со стороны. Первым признаком ""спирали"" была легкая, одно-двухнедельная щетина и всклокоченные, месяцами нестриженые волосы.И вот здесь самую отвратительную роль начинали играть родственники и близкие люди.Сначала они принимали всё как ""временное явление"", до новой работы, потом - как часть обычной жизни: ""Он же всё делает по дому, не пьет, не колется, деньги не таскает, баб - не водит. Лишних расходов с меня - пачка хороших сигарет в день и бутылка пива по субботам. Могу себе позволить. Всё нормально!"". И в финале, когда становилось понятно, что человек годами не выходит из дома и ни с кем вне семьи не разговаривает и нет денег: ""Так получилось. Сказали, что можно оформить ему ""инвалидность"", но ведь его никуда не вытащишь, а денег на такси у нас нет"". Кончалось всё по абсолютно банальным причинам: скатывание в гиподинамию, сердечная недостаточность, флебит, ампутации и ранняя смерть.Вытащить из такого состояния человека очень сложно. И прежде всего потому, что он долгое время вызревает в комфортном ""коконе"" заботы родственников, не считающих это состояние чем-то из ряда вон, не требующим стороннего вмешательства или финансовых затрат.  #работа #metaverse #агорафобия",4,7,1

Уж если ранжирование сделало из никому неизвестной GPT-3 Chat-GPT, то и тебе пригодится) Также множество полезных знаний для построения поисковых систем.2) Ценообразование - модуль достаточно специфичекский, на приактике не применял, в целом неплохо.3) А/Б - это уже мой третий курс по аб, и как у предыдущих, если не делаешь тесты на работе, то все забывается через месяц. В курсе упор сделан, на подготовку тестов. Меня удивило сколько разнообразных соломок можно подстелить до начала теста, плюс техники снижения дисперсии - куча новой и полезной информации. Задания немного странные - нельзя переиспользовать код в финальном проекте, но можно брать код с семинаров.4) Uplift - также как ЦО достаточно специфический курс, но мне очень понравилась компановка модуля - в финальном проекте надо просто собрать код предыдущих ДЗ.5) Deploy - супер сложный модуль (если делать фин проект с кодом), потратил на него гораздо больше времени, чем на ранжирование, но и пользы от него больше. Дается представление о многих фундаментальных вещах: как мастбируются сервисы, почему не надо ставить model.predict() под async и другие инженерные штуки. Очень часто использую в работе, и в целом уверенее себя чувствуешь на систем дизайнах с коллегами и девопсами.В двух словах про сам курс: поддержка отвечает долго и туманно. Сначало это раздражает, но потом адаптируешься и закладываешь время на общение с поддержкой в ДЗ. С какого-то момента стал относится к этому как к части курса, а не к припятствию на пути его прохождения. Типо это бихэйв интервью с вопросами: Strong Disagreement, Production Outage и т.д) Иногда правильный код не отрабатывает на грейдере, и нужно доказать это поддержке - также относиться к предыдущему пункту. В таких случаях, кстати, отмечу адекватность поддержки - любой вопрос можно решить.P.S курс я закончил еще в январе, но все не доходили руки написать пост, возможно уже поменялось",8,6,1

We saw a lot of #layoffs posts and people asked me to refer them, help to find the next opportunity and the job.I helped people and connect with my other friends from other companies as well, helped with mock interviews and reviewed a lot of CVs. And I realized - people looking for a tool to find the job referrals and mock interviews faster and in an automation way to do it instead of tons of WhatsUp and Telegram channels, Google Spreadsheets and chats in LinkedIn. We built a service to help people to find the job referrals faster, find and help people with job interviews and I’m glad to share - https://referrs.me.I truly believe the idea of the community for such things, a lot of great and bright people looking the job now and a lot of bright people can refer them or know somebody who can refer. We are just lunching and as we saw - a lot of people in difficult financial situations now - so we made this service completely FREE. We are engineers who want to help other people to find the job faster, because we know how hard is it. If you have any questions or suggestions about the service - don’t hesitate to send me the feedback anywhere.Also - as our service is the community - I would like to ask you to share this service with your friends, colleagues, because maybe not their, but people whom they know - looking the referrals right now.#layoff #job #community #people #help #automation #jobinterviews #engineers #opportunity #share #referrals #referrals #mockinterviews #mockinterview",5,,8
