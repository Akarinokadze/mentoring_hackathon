Решился взять, потому что a) деньги лишними не бывают и б) было бы ему очень сложно найти разработчика, который согласился бы взять за такое в праздники не за баснословную сумму (хоть у меня приличный почасовой ценник, я сделал большую скидку 😑 ). Так в чем безумие? В основном, я пишу на Angular, поэтому, множество вещей, которые есть в angular и к которым я привык, я не мог использовать.Однако, я кайфовал от процесса) В общем, с утра отправил рабочее приложение и как мне кажется, оно очень качественно сделано) А теперь, прикрепляю изображение, как я мог бы выглядеть в 18-м веке, если бы работал frontend разработчиком в праздники 😄",,,

It could be fiction or nonfiction.Tip 2 - Once you find what to read define where and when to read Ex - I like to read after dinner everyday in the study room for 15-30 minutes.Tip 3 - Try to maintain a tracker where you can cross or mark your everyday progress. It will gives you the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.Tip 4 - Do not try to complete the book if it does not excite you even after 50 pages, Because it's not only your responsibility to finish the book, the book itself has to be interesting so that we can complete it. Bonus Tip - Make it easy and obvious do not try to finish a book a day just start small 5-10 pages a day and if someday you haven't get time to read then don't feel guilty it's okay to miss somedays.#habitbuilding #readerscommunity #bookreader #learningeveryday #growingeveryday",2.0,3.0,1.0

Заполнить профиль в линке, откликаться на hh и параллельно узучать новое, как я делал раньше, это слишком пассивный вариант. Нужно ломиться в каждую открытую и не очень дверь, заявлять о себе рекрутерам, по возможности знакомится с людьми со схожей деятельностью. В этой жизни засчитываются только действия, а не просто твои хотелки, которые так и могут остаться у тебя в голове без должной реализации.

Наверно многие кто составлял пост о поиске работы предварительно гуглил как ""Правильно"" это делать: причина поиска, чем будешь полезен, цели, навыки и куча бессмысленных смайликов 🔥. Я даже просил ChatGPT составить пост о поиске работы. По итогу решил отказаться от советов шаблонного написания и от ChatGPT. Возможно я неправильно и непрофессионально заявляю о себе, за то сам.

Architectural patterns make it easier to solve these issues by providing repeatable designs that address common situations.An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture. Architectural patterns are similar to software design patterns but have a broader scope.Here are the most common architectural patterns:𝟭. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗛𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Used to optimize webpage loading time by storing static content separately from dynamic content𝟮. 𝗣𝗲𝗲𝗿-𝘁𝗼-𝗣𝗲𝗲𝗿: Involves multiple components called Peers, where a pear may function both as a client, requesting services from other peers, and as a server, providing services to other peers.𝟯. 𝗣𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗿-𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿: Used to send (publishes) relevant messages to places that have subscribed to a topic.𝟰. 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 – Used to partition data in a database to speed commands or queries.𝟱. 𝗖𝗶𝗿𝗰𝘂𝗶𝘁 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿: Helps make systems more fault tolerant by minimizing the effects of a hazard by rerouting traffic to another service.𝟲. 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻: Generally used to develop applications that include groups of subtasks that execute in a specific order.𝟳. 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿: A peer-to-peer architecture that is comprised of a client, which requests a service, and a server, which provides the service.𝟴. 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿-𝗦𝗹𝗮𝘃𝗲: Consists of two components; the master distributes the work among identical slaves and computes a final result from the results which the slaves return.𝟵. 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲-𝗙𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿: Used to structure systems that produce and process a stream of data.𝟭𝟬. 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻: Uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.𝟭𝟭. 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹-𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄-𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: Divides an application into three components. The model contains the application's data and main functionality; the view displays data and interacts with the user; and the controller handles user input and acts as the mediator between the model and the view.𝟭𝟮. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿: Used to interpret a higher level language to a lower level language to execute a series of commands directly.𝟭𝟯. 𝗠𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀: Used to create multiple services that work interdependently to create a larger application.𝟭𝟰. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗦𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Used to separate read and write activities to provide greater stability, scalability, and performance.Ref:✅Grokking the System Design Interview: https://lnkd.in/g4Wii9r7✅Grokking the Advanced System Design Interview: https://lnkd.in/dyCRtiec",9.0,9.0,7.0

Use the form ""Search"" on the top of your LinkedIn page, the fill the position (for example, Project manager) and after it choose the country and locations. You have to add people only WITH short cover message, not without any kind of words!3. Liked posts and commented it. I always update my home page and have a look on the posts of my Network. It is ipmortant to pay attention to like and write comments below these posts because it affects your SSI score. Use hashtags (especially #linkedin) in each message.4. Created my own posts. It is simple and last, but not the least. Whether I have any sort of a curious article or I want to share my current SSI, I make a post on my page and show/share it with my network. It is establishing of my brand here. I do all these things daily and it became as a routine.

          …См. еще",2.0,Россия,4,"Уже вчера я получил наконец свою электронную версию документа о профессиональной переподготовке от Яндекс.Практикум по курсу Веб-разработчик Плюс. Позади 18 месяцев учебы. Я уже работаю по новой специальности как фронтенд разработчик в небольшом стартапе. После 3 месяцев учебы я уже писал отзыв о курсе, но полагаю все же будет честным написать еще один отзыв по завершению, так как теперь представляю картину в целом. Немного вводных. Я с детства увлекаюсь компьютерами, но высшее образование в свое время получил по специальности Юриспруденция. Был юристом более 8 лет, сопровождал строительные проекты. Участвовал и в довольно крупных проектах. Поэтому, хоть и был уверенным пользователем компьютера, но с программированием был знаком на уровне школьной программы, где нас когда-то давно учили программировать на Turbo Pascal. Решил сменить свой профиль по причине того, что выгорел на своей работе, видя, что мой труд является формальным и никому не нужен. Почему выбрал Практикум? Потому что они обещали отчислить, если вовремя не буду сдавать работы. У меня к этому довольно специфичное отношение, я очень часто вижу вокруг людей, которые считают, что им обязаны. Я сегодня пришел в офис - вы обязаны мне платить (и не важно, что ты сидишь весь день в телефоне и не работаешь), я пришел в университет - вы обязаны дать мне диплом о высшем образовании (и не важно, что ты еще в первый день первого курса забил болт на учебу), я оплатил курс - вы обязаны устроить меня в IT, где я буду получать трилиард рублей в наносекунду попивая смузи на пляжах Бали. Категорически не считаю такую позицию правильной. Более того, потакание такой позиции ради наживы и выгоды, губит систему образование как таковую. Можно было допустить, что Практикум написал это в целях рекламы, но, во-первых, мне кажется это скорее антиреклама, а во-вторых у меня есть цифры моего потока. 7-я когорта в октябре 2021 года стартовала в составе 75 человек (+/- пара человек, но по-моему это были люди из команды сопровождения). Вчера выпустилось всего 15 человек. Это с учётом того, что на протяжении всего периода обучения к  нам переводились студенты со старших потоков, которые уходили в академ. Поэтому можете сами посчитать процент выживания на курсе. Из этого следует вторая особенность данного курса - много сложного материала и много практических работ. Вам точно не хватит 2-3 часов в неделю на прохождение курса. Минимум 4 часа ежедневной работы. Поэтому если у вас ограничено время - курс вам не подойдет. Я хочу искренне выразить признательность своей жене за терпение. Иногда казалось, что она готова выгнать меня из дома, потому что приходилось много времени тратить не на семью, а на учебу. Но при этом, материала, который дает курс не достаточно что бы с хода залететь разработчиком в Яндекс или Сбер. Объясняется это довольно просто. В качестве конкурентов у вас будут выпускники технических вузов, которые 11 лет изучали математику, программирование, потом еще 5-6 лет в вузе... Продолжение в комменте",7.0,1.0,

Consider using Redux!Redux is a state management library that can help simplify and organize your application's state. It works seamlessly with React, allowing you to easily connect your components to your state and update it as needed.With Redux, you can centralize your state and easily share it between components. This means that you can avoid passing props down through multiple layers of components and instead access your state from anywhere in your application.Redux also offers powerful tools for debugging and tracking state changes, making it easier to find and fix issues in your code.So if you're looking for a way to simplify state management in your React application, consider giving Redux a try!#Redux #ReactRedux #StateManagement #WebDevelopment #FrontEndDevelopment #JavaScript #Programming #Developer #SoftwareDevelopment #FrontEnd #BackEnd #SinglePageApplication #SPA #AppDevelopment #Code #CodingCommunity #TechTalks #CodeNewbie #ReduxStore #ReactNative",6.0,5.0,5.0

А дальше начинается, на мой взгляд, самый сложный этап - поиск первой работы. Начитавшись и насмотревшись различных историй ребят, которые ищут первую работку без опыта, в которых они оставляют по 100-200 откликов на вакансии, а их не приглашают даже на одно собеседование, становиться как-то не по себе. Сразу начинаешь примерять эти истории на себя, и думаешь, но как-то же некоторые ребята устраиваются на работу и даже без опыта, неужели я хуже чем они? Сразу в голове начинают ползать тараканы, и возникают вопросы, ""а что если у меня не получиться?"".Но очень придает сил осознание того, что я не один на этой дороге, сейчас тысячи таких же ребят с мечтами стать настоящими разработчиками работают над собой, чтобы максимально приблизиться к этой цели, даже сейчас пока я пишу этот текст, кто-то проходит собеседование, кто-то решает тестовое задание, кто-то просто изучает что-то новое.Поэтому ребят, если вам также как и мне нужна поддержка, ставьте лайки, пишите комментарии, как вы проходите этот путь, делитесь своими мыслями. И может благодаря этому данный пост увидят больше Эйчаров и Рекрутеров. А более опытные ребята, которые уже когда-то прошли это путь, помогут и нам его успешно пройти. Спасибо за внимание!P.S.

Давай знакомиться!Меня зовут Максим, мне 27 и на этой страничке я буду делиться своей историей по названием: ""Как я попал в IT"".Думаю мои школьные годы и годы учебы в ВУЗе тебе не особо интересны, поэтому начну рассказ со своей работы в армии. К слову закончил я Военную академию связи в  Питере.По условиям контракта я должен после окончания академии еще 5 лет отработать в армии. Очень большой срок, но деваться было не куда.Попал я служить в Махачкалу (Респ. Дагестан), где мне пришлось руководить взводом из 20-ти человек, среди которых были и мужчины и женщины, а самому младшему было на 5 лет больше, чем мне)) Именно поэтому я не жалею, что мне пришлось пройти такой путь длинной почти в 10 лет в армии, это был полезный опыт.Но как же я пришел к Айтишке, спросишь ты меня? Да все просто, мне захотелось грести бабло лопатой, а в АйТи же очень много платят. Ладно шучу-шучу 😁  Дело конечно не в деньгах, я и в армии получал точно больше, чем джуны, еще и аренду квартиры оплачивали и была возможность взять военную ипотеку. А вот, что меня привлекло в АйТи так это возможность безграничного роста и развития, свобода выбора где работать, на какую компанию, какими проектами заниматься, возможность работы в кругу единомышленников, возможность вносить большой вклад в какой-либо полезный продукт, ни и другие плюшки: крутой офис или удаленка, рост скилов + много работы = много денег))Мой путь и поиск себя в АйТи начался летом 2021 года, когда по совету друга я начала учить Питон. Учился я на курсе, но как это бывает у новичков, мне хотелось видеть результат своей работы, а после 3-трех месяцев изучения Питона, я его так и не увидел. Поэтому мой взор упал на iOS-разработку на swift'е. Всегда нравилась продукция Apple, красивые и плавные анимации на айфонах. Поэтому с февраля по сентябрь я учил swift. Но ближе к окончанию курса, когда я уже немного проникся сферой АйТи и разобрался, как тут все устроено, я понял, что рисовать красивые кнопочки, различные анимации - это, конечно, прикольно, но мне хочется заниматься чем-то более интересным. Мой выбор, во многом благодаря, моему другу Шему, кстати тоже бывшему военному, остановился на бэкэнде, в связке с Гошечкой.Почему Гошка? Конечно же из-за няшного маскота )) Ну а так у Гошки есть еще ряд преимуществ, на мой взгляд, это простота в изучении=низкий порог входа, молодой, но очень перспективный язык, куча приятностей из коробки.Поэтому в сентябре я уволился со всех подработок, и приступил к плотному изучению Гошки и бэкэнда под руководством крутого ментора и просто хорошего человека Олега Козырева. Надеюсь я смогу быстро осваивать новый материал и у меня не закончиться еда на пол-пути 😅 P.S.  Очень интересно узнать твою историю, поделись и ты ей в комментариях!",7.0,8.0,

Today I'd like to share my experience with a project I've been working on as a Junior+ Python web developer.The project is a web application that helps people manage their expenses. It allows users to add their income, expenses, and view statistics on their spending. It was developed using the Flask framework and PostgreSQL for the database.One of the challenges I faced during this project was designing the database schema. I had to ensure that the tables and relationships between them were set up in a way that would allow for efficient querying and easy maintenance. Additionally, I had to implement authentication and authorization to ensure that users could only access their own data.Another challenge was developing the user interface. I wanted to make it as user-friendly as possible, while also ensuring that it looked clean and professional. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end development, and JavaScript for some additional functionality.Despite the challenges, I am proud of what I was able to accomplish. It was rewarding to see the project come together and be used by real people. I also learned a lot about project management and working with a team, as I collaborated with other developers and a project manager to complete the project.Overall, this project was a great experience and it reinforced my passion for Python and web development. I'm excited to continue working on projects like this and to learn more along the way.Thanks for reading and I'd love to hear about your experiences with web development or any interesting projects you're working on.

Под безопасностью исходного кода мы подразумеваем некий процент допущенных в исходном коде ошибок, связанный с особенностями применяемого языка или технологии. Дело в том, что довольно большую роль играет человеческий фактор: люди могут попросту ошибиться или владеть инструментом разработки в недостаточной степени.

As a React developer, I would like to share some practical usages I use myself for the tool below:1. Error debugging: Instead of waiting for a response to your Stack Overflow question or sifting through lengthy documentation, you can use ChatGPT to get instant help with debugging code. Simply provide the relevant code snippet to ChatGPT and ask your question, and the AI tool will provide you with a possible solution. If the response doesn't satisfy your query, ChatGPT can search the internet for an answer and provide you with an updated solution. No more time-consuming debugging!2. Array operations and function creation: ChatGPT can also be used as a low-code tool, allowing developers to describe a function's purpose and have ChatGPT provide the necessary code. For instance, when dealing with data retrieval from an API, ChatGPT can provide the necessary code to display object data in a card format, without the need for you to spend hours on boilerplate code.3. SEO text generation: ChatGPT can even generate SEO-friendly text that adheres to best practices. As developers, we know that crafting effective SEO copy is important but time-consuming. With ChatGPT, you can simply enter the necessary requirements and the AI tool will generate the text for you.That's all I have for today. Go try the tool already :D",1.0,1.0,

          …См. еще",2.0,"Москва, Москва, Россия",9,"The wave of popularity of chatGPT has reached me. The impression is shocking in the best sense of the word.Getting access to it cost me 45 rubles (instructions for bypassing the sanctions ban on Russian numbers can be easily googled).What I have tried:1. Foreign language lessonsThe chat suggested different options for practicing English, talked to me sincerely about books, asking pertinent questions. I also taught a couple of words in Japanese. I asked him to ask five words in English so that I would answer him in Japanese (romaji, to be exact). At first, the chat forgot to remove the translation for the suggested words, but after a couple of instructions I understood the exercise (and even apologized).2. Help in creating a chapter for Naruto fanfiction.According to the plot, I had to describe the celebration of the birthday of the heiress of the Hyuga clan and reveal on it the internal conflicts of its two branches. The chat helped with the plan of the holiday, and with the nature of the possible claims between the ninja. At the same time, taking into account the cultural characteristics of Japan and the world of Naruto.3. Junior Data Scientist CVVideos on YouTube lie - chat knows how to write a resume.My observations:1. Chat holds the context of the dialogue. It is not clear if he can lose it at all.2. Typical chat response: warning that the answer belongs to the machine -> multiple answers -> conclusion.3. There is an emotional color in speech, but of a weakly expressed positive character. Chat often emphasizes its technological nature. According to personal feelings, the ideal interlocutor for all those topics that do not interest your friends. Finally someone to talk to about this!4. Responds quickly in English. In response to Russian speech, he often answers in English. With a direct request to translate something into Russian (I assume this also applies to other languages), the response speed is significantly reduced.P.S. For fans of Naruto anime. I tried to get the chat to figure out how many people can be in the main and side branches and how the branch system works in the perspective of past generations (conditionally, how the main branch has not degenerated if everyone except the eldest child of the main family is stigmatized). Here the chat broke and could not solve the problem. I had to invent it myself :) With a competent series of questions, I'm sure the chat can help many writers with their incomprehensible dilemmas.#chatGPT #datascience #anime #ml",2.0,,

Кажется, что оборудовать себе небольшое рабочее место на улице или проводить созвоны во время прогулок по лесу - довольно приятный вариант :)После долгих лет жизни в Москве и многочисленных переездов я определил для себя вещи, которые важны для меня при выборе квартиры. Я бы хотел жить там, где развита инфраструктура, есть приятное комьюнити и красивая природа, а дорога до города не занимала бы много времени. Сегодня я расскажу про жилой комплекс, который я недавно открыл для себя.ЖК ""Парк Апрель"" - это закрытый охраняемый комплекс, расположенный в 20 минутах от МКАД. Здесь вы найдете квартиры формата SkyLoft с потолками до 7 метров и GardenFlat с выходом на придомовую территорию. А для тех, кто любит проводить время на свежем воздухе, на территории ЖК обустроен прогулочный бульвар с различными зонами для отдыха и досуга. Каждый двор имеет детские площадки, а ценители природы могут прогуляться по лесу или дойти до одной из двух рек, которые проходят недалеко от комплекса.До конца мая у них действует акция: квартиры с выгодой до 1,9 млн руб.!Переходите по ссылке за подробностями: https://clck.ru/34KojH",5.0,2.0,

Сегодня я расскажу, как работают рекомендации на платформе Spotify, какие методы используются для анализа ваших музыкальных предпочтений и как система определяет, какие композиции, артисты и плейлисты могут вам понравиться. Я являюсь большим поклонником Spotify, много лет слежу за их развитием и активно использую их платформу с первых дней выхода в России. Я прочитал книгу, в которой детально описывается, как создавалась эта чудесная компания. Авторы книги рассказали, что стояло за теми технологическими решениями, которые сделали компанию лидером рынка. Всем советую к прочтению. Рекомендательные системы — это комплекс сервисов и алгоритмов, который анализирует предпочтения пользователей и пытается предсказать, что может их заинтересовать. Spotify использует гибридную рекомендательную систему, которая комбинирует коллаборативную фильтрацию и контентную фильтрацию. Это означает, что система учитывает не только предпочтения пользователей, но и свойства самой музыки, чтобы дать наиболее подходящие рекомендации. Коллаборативная фильтрация основана на истории прослушивания пользователя и его рейтингах песен. Система анализирует данные о том, какие песни и артисты пользователь слушает, и сравнивает его предпочтения с другими пользователями, которые слушают похожие песни. Это позволяет системе предложить пользователю новые песни и артистов, которые могут ему понравиться. Контентная фильтрация, с другой стороны, основана на свойствах музыки, таких как жанр, темп, инструменты. Система анализирует музыкальные характеристики песен, которые пользователь слушает, и использует эту информацию для предложения новых песен, которые имеют схожие свойства. Кроме того, Spotify использует анализ текста песен и других аудио-функций, чтобы помочь вам найти новую музыку. Это означает, что если вы ищете что-то специфическое, такое как романтические песни, система может рекомендовать вам подходящую музыку на основе текстов песен. Одним из главных инструментов, используемых Spotify для рекомендаций, является функция Discover Weekly. Это персонализированный плейлист, который создается каждую неделю и составляется на основе истории прослушивания пользователя и предпочтениях аналогичных слушателей. Наконец, Spotify также предлагает пользователю различные функции и инструменты для настройки своего аккаунта, в том числе возможность блокировать определенные исполнителей и песни, чтобы улучшить рекомендации. Сегодня мы рассмотрели, как работают их рекомендательные системы, какие методы используются для анализа пользовательских данных и как эти системы помогают пользователям находить новую музыку, которая соответствует их вкусам и настроению. А как вам рекомендательные системы Spotify?Больше контента про аналитику, работу и IT можно найти у меня на канале: https://lnkd.in/eDJEzXje#spotify",6.0,,

На примере одной из игр в нашем приложении мы рассказали, что такое геймификация, какой эффект от нее получает бизнес и как мы используем игровые механики в Альфе. «Геймификация – это превращение обычного процесса или задачи в игру, в которой пользователи мотивируются достигать поставленные цели и получать особую награду. Она позволяет использовать принципы игрового дизайна для увеличения уровня мотивации и повышения производительности в процессах или службах» Это определение я получил от ChatGPT :)Но если говорить простыми словами, то геймификация — это когда серьезные сервисы и проекты используют игровые механики, чтобы сделать скучные занятия интереснымиНапример, по пути на работу вы набираете очки в Duolingo, угадываете фильмы в игре на день рождения Кинопоиска, а потом сканируете купон из приложения кофейни, чтобы получить шестую чашку бесплатно.

Оно ведёт к истощению эмоциональных и личностных ресурсов человека. Выгорание возникает в результате внутреннего накапливания отрицательных эмоций без их высвобождения. Сегодня расскажу про то, как с ним можно бороться 🛌Раньше я хорошо справлялся с выгоранием, но какое-то время назад что-то пошло не так. Я не могу встать вовремя, мне тяжело собрать себя в руки, у меня пропала всякая тяга к работе и любым положительным эмоциям 😕В попытках сдвинуть этот образ жизни я изучил множество статей и вернулся к тем практикам, которые раньше мне помогали. Методы ниже не являются универсальными - вам нужно будет пробовать самим, чтобы понять, что подходит именно вам 🍗Поехали, 4 пункта для победы над выгоранием:1. Определите источник проблемыВыгорание возникает из-за длительного игнорирования источников стресса. Источником может быть множество дедлайнов, переработки, постоянное переключение между проектами, личные проблемы 2. Планируйте свой деньВ интернетах пишут, что нужно вернуть контроль над своим временем. Я начал вести бумажный ежедневник, где расписываю личные и рабочие задачи на день. Ещё я начал делить день на временные блоки и ставить будильники на завершение работыСейчас я пытаюсь вставать пораньше, чтобы заниматься приятными для меня делами в виде курсовой и чтения. Ещё мне помогает спортзал с тренером в 7:00, а прогулять это не получится3. Расставьте приоритетыЯ выделяю главные задачи, которые мне нужно закрыть, и фокусируюсь на них. Стараюсь брать основные направления работы, декомпозировать их на мелкие задачи и идти по определённому списку. В жизни - та же история4. Не забывайте отдыхатьИз-за учебы у меня нет как такового часового перерыва на обед — ем я за компьютером во время работы. Каждую среду я беру часовой обед, ухожу в кафе и смотрю там за едой новый эпизод сериала. По субботам первую половину дня я работаю из кофейни, а прогулки по улице перед сном здорово освежают головуУ меня недавно брали интервью (https://lnkd.in/effThhGh) для журнала ""Код"", где мы в том числе обсуждали выгорание и мой график (выгорания, да. там буквально написано понедельник, вторник я выгораю, а остальные дни я потихоньку восстанавливаюсь)Если вы, как и я, постоянно чувствуете усталость, отсутствие тяги к ранее интересным делам и испытываете вечную тревожность - это повод задуматься и начать что-то менять. Лично я продолжу экспериментировать и постараюсь вернуться в прежнее русло. К тому же, через неделю я ухожу в отпуск для написания курсовой 👀А как вы справляетесь с выгоранием? Или не справляетесь.

Если ранее работать из дома было возможно только в ряде профессий и случаев, то сейчас удаленка - очень распространенный формат работы. Но всем ли подойдет работа в удаленном режиме?У такого формата работы много плюсов:● Не нужно тратить время на дорогу. В Москве это может занимать до 4х часов в день● Работа в собственном ритме. Можно просыпаться прям перед началом рабочего дня, носить любую одежду, спать во время обеда, работать из кровати● Выше концентрация. Коллеги пишут только по делу и никто не зовёт играть в приставку● Больше времени на семью и друзей● Возможность путешествоватьНо есть и минусы:● Нехватка социализации. Даже пара шуток или короткий поход за кофе в офисе разбавляют рабочий день и позволяют отдохнуть. Работая из дома, общение с коллегами происходит только по поводу задач, а живой коммуникации это не заменит● Ненормированный рабочий день. Если в офисе работа заканчивается после выхода из здания, то работа из дома не заканчивается никогда. По крайней мере, так происходит у меня. Я могу начать работать в 7 утра и закончить в 8 вечера, потому что всегда сижу за ноутбуком и не замечаю, как проходит день● Снижение мотивации. Когда человек не находится в коллективе и не чувствует единения с компанией и командой, у него снижается желание работать. Человек превращается в некого робота, которому приходят задачки, которые он решает за деньги. Если компания не проводит активностей внутри, то отношения окончательно сводятся к товаро-денежным● Меньше плюшек. Чай за свой счёт● Отсутствие хорошего рабочего места. Не у всех есть возможность организовать себе рабочее пространство надлежащим образом● Физическая форма. Люди реже выходят из дома и меньше передвигаютсяМногие компании уже вернулись или начали возвращаться в офис по тем или иным причинам. Вводятся ограничения по заграничной работе, людей просят вернуться в офисЛично мне не нравится полностью удаленная работа. Я очень ценю личное общение и работа для меня - больше, чем просто источник дохода, который сводится к выполнению задач.

Matthew, выступая от лица множества пользователей, требует $9 млрд компенсации 💰А что же сегодня? Этот же коллектив 13го января подал в суд на Stability AI и Midjourney, на две крупнейшие компании, которые занимаются разработкой моделей, позволяющих генерировать изображения на основе текста. В иск добавили и DeviantArt, крупнейшее в мире сообщество художников, использующее изображения пользователей. Энтузиасты собрали в табличке огромный (https://lnkd.in/epDnG7vp) лист artist’ов, которые есть в датасете MidjourneyJoseph Saveri, основатель юридической фирмы, которая представляет интересы истцов, заявляет: «Поскольку развивающиеся технологии продолжают изменять каждый аспект современного мира, крайне важно, чтобы мы признавали и защищали права художников от незаконных краж и мошенничества. Это дело представляет собой самую масштабную борьбу за сохранение прав собственности для всех художников и других создателей» 🤲Их позиция подробно изложена на сайте https://lnkd.in/eUUgsnHc, а изучить иск можно по этой (https://lnkd.in/e6jDGhEU) ссылке. С точки зрения технических аспектов иск составлен не совсем корректно — оно и понятно, люди в этом не разбираются. Например, художники утверждают, что нейросети хранят защищённые авторским правом изображения, а затем «рекомбинируют» их. Но эти модели хранят не изображения, а математические представления узоров, собранных из этих изображений, а после обработки создают изображения с нуля 😕Интерес заключается в том, что эти компании не зарабатывают денег, а соответственно, не делятся ими. Коллектив не стал разбираться с более крупными OpenAI и DALLE2, которые с первого дня являются коммерческими — вместо этого они судятся с менее защищенными компаниями, которые строятся на open source решениях. Вполне возможно, что всё это инициировано ради внимания 🔔В конечном итоге, искусство так и работает — человек наблюдает за другими работами, вдохновляется, берёт кусочки чужого материала и создаёт что-то своё. Как говорил Пабло Пикассо: «Un artista copia, un gran artista roba», что переводится как «Хорошие художники копируют, великие художники воруют»Эти два случая могут стать судебными прецедентами, которые будут также влиять при вынесении следующих решений в подобных делах. Лично мне интересно будет понаблюдать за созданием судебной практики в отношении моделей, которые обучаются на публичных данныхА как вы считаете, нарушают ли эти модели авторское право?

Автор рассказал, как ему удалось перевести свою команду на четырехдневную рабочую неделю. Предпосылками для этого служили постоянные пожары, переработки, проблемы с коммуникацией и постоянное выгорание сотрудников, что приводило к низкой продуктивностиПосле того, как команда начала устраивать себе выходной в среду, её производительность выросла, о чем свидетельствуют графики в Jira и хороший фидбек от заказчиков.Нужно понимать, что они не стали трудиться 4 дня по 10 часов — их рабочее время осталось тем же, но количество выполненных задач, как и их качество, не уменьшилось. Сотрудники стали испытывать меньше стресса, увеличили эффективность и перестали выгорать 👉В России такая практика ещё не применяется, но Европа сейчас активно переходит на четырехдневную рабочую неделю. Например, одни из самых продуктивных стран в мире, такие как Норвегия, Дания, Германия и Нидерланды в среднем работают 27 часов в неделю. С другой стороны, Япония, известная за свои переработки, находится на 21м месте из 42 в списке самых продуктивных стран В исследовании от Stanford University была выявлена взаимосвязь между производительностью и часами в рабочей неделе. Перегруженные сотрудники оказывались менее продуктивными, чем те, кто работали в меньше 🗿Я с радостью работал бы 4 дня по 10+ часов или пожертвовал бы частью дохода в пользу такого графика.

Мне нужно было закрыть все рабочие задачи в последнюю неделю перед отпуском, а из-за болезни это сместилось, и я частично закрывал их во время сессии 🌅Я всё же встал на ноги и смог частично реализовать задуманное — полететь в Сочи, чтобы покататься на сноуборде и сходить в коворкинг Альфы. О последнем я и расскажу в этом посте 😊Как я писал в прошлом посте (https://lnkd.in/epcjrnZg) про мотивацию от компании, Альфа уже второй год подряд открывает коворкинги в Краснодарском Крае, зимой — в Красной Поляне. Коворк открыт с середины декабря до середины мартаВ коворкинге много места, которое разделяется на блоки — тут тебе и переговорки, и кофейные столики, и барные стойки, и пуфики, и диванчики. В отличие от московских коворков, атмосфера очень неформальная - это не классический оупэнспэйс, где можно заблудиться в сотне рядов рабочих местИз приятностей — здесь можно взять блокнот с ручкой, выпить кофе со сладостями или взять повэр банк для телефона. А ещё рядом находится казино, куда можно сходить во время обеда и просадить квартальную премиюРасположение удобное — коворкинг находится в ТЦ в центре курорта. Внизу есть фудкорт, где можно поесть, а если выйти на улицу, то можно за минуту дойти до Surf Coffee или до стопочнойИзначально я со скептицизмом отнёсся к такой идее — я заселился в отель с хорошим рабочим местом и думал, что работать там будет комфортнее, чем в коворкинге, но я ошибался — здесь очень приятноБольше контента про аналитику, работу и IT можно найти у меня на канале: https://lnkd.in/eDJEzXje 😌",4.0,6.0,

Удалённые сотрудники не привязаны к офису и могут работать оттуда — там есть переговорки, мягкие уголки, Wi-Fi, печеньки и всё, что нужно для работы 🍪Летом у нас открыто 2 коворкинга в Сочи, которые находятся в Олимпийском парке и в центре города. Помимо рабочих мест, летом Альфа предлагает занятия йогой, растяжкой и зумбой на пляже, а по выходным — экскурсии на чайные плантации, в Абхазию и по достопримечательностям Сочи 🤔Зимой Альфа открывает коворкинг в Красной Поляне. Кстати, он находится в соседнем здании от места, где я жил в прошлом году — забавное совпадение. Главная концепция такой локации — горнолыжный курорт. После работы можно заниматься зимними активностями или просто дышать свежим воздухом. Помимо рабочих мест, компания бесплатно предоставляет инструктора, который проводит занятия по катанию на горных лыжах и сноуборде 🤗 Мне кажется, что это очень классная инициатива для предотвращения выгорания и смены обстановки. Не будь у меня учебы, я бы меньше выгорал и точно работал бы из другого офиса 😲 Как вам такая перезагрузка?

Так, в августе я посетил Летнюю школу (https://cs.hse.ru/mlbio/) по ML в биоинформатике. Спикеры на протяжении трех дней в интерактивном формате рассказывали про прикладную биоинформатику, современные методы анализа данных, молекулярную биологию и многое другое 🤔 Сегодня расскажу про бесплатную Зимнюю школу по аналитике и Data Science (https://lnkd.in/e4SWBm66), которая пройдет 28-29 января в Москве в здании Вышки. Участвовать можно всем, а основной фокус идёт на тех, кто задумывается над переходом или только начал погружаться в эту область 😄 О чем будут рассказывать:⏺ Какие сегодня есть тренды в AI и как устроены современные технологии?⏺ Как Data Science применяется в разных индустриях?⏺ Что нужно изучить, чтобы стать аналитиком данных или DS?⏺ Можно ли стать аналитиком с непрофильным образованием и на что смотрят HR?Отличные спикеры, некоторых из них я даже знаю лично - с Максимом Стаценко из Яндекса мы регулярно пересекаемся на митапах и конференциях. Помимо него там будут аналитики и DS из Яндекса, Сбера, Х5, МТС, Ozon и Rambler. Мой рекомендасьон ✋Я посоветовал посетить школу нескольким своим знакомым и сам планирую послушать несколько интересных мне докладов.

Первая встреча прошла 25го августа в Москве, куда я ходил в оффлайне. Рассказываю, как всё прошло 😄 Было 3 доклада, в ходе которых спикеры вещали не про менеджмент, а про разработку: про то, как в условиях ограниченного времени и ресурсов запускать крутые продукты. В среднем они длились по 30 минут, а после каждого выступления были Q&A сессии на 15 минут 🙂 После официальной части началось неформальное общение с закусками, выпивкой и личными вопросами докладчикам. Люди стояли за столиками, ели и общались - про мероприятие, работу и все остальное. Можно было подойти к спикерам и обсудить интересующий тебя вопрос. Я даже нашел там нескольких человек, с которыми состою в чатах в тг 👉Но что за машина и как я её получил? Хорошая практика для вовлечение аудитории - дарить подарки за лучший вопрос в рамках Q&A сессии. Я задал вопрос, а спикер выбрал его самым интересным среди остальных 10-15 вопросов, после чего мне вручили очередную машинку в мою коллекцию.

Проводят их энтузиасты, которые хотят вечером после работы пообщаться с людьми и поделиться своим решением🐶Для меня митапы - это про нэтворкинг. Это про возможность познакомиться с новыми людьми, неформально обсудить с ними работу и понять, что другие специалисты испытывают такие же проблемы, как и ты. Это про то, как после доклада на афтепати с пиццей и напитками общаться со спикером и напрямую задавать вопросы, которые помогут тебе в работе или расширят твой кругозор.На митапах можно найти работу, сформировать профессиональные связи, получить совет по карьерному треку, вдохновиться и понять, что мир айти гораздо меньше, чем кажется ☺️Например, летом я ходил на Data Science MeetUp от Alfa Digital, выиграл там балансборд в конкурсе костюмов и понял, что это очень классная компания с очень классной столовой.

И уже тогда знаний было достаточно, чтобы понять, что мы скорее изучаем историю того, как разрабатывали, а не как нужно сейчас. Денег на обучение не было, но зато был компьютер, что уже половина успеха. Помидоры готовы? Я смотрел спираченные курсы HTML Academy. Они, конечно, были “прошлогодние” и без плюшек в виде наставника и домашних заданий. Мне нужно было решить вопрос, а кто может провести ревью моей финальной работы. Я много помогал новеньким на форуме той же академии и посчитал, что могу попросить ревью кода у более опытных разработчиков там же. И на мою просьбу откликнулись из самой академии (не наставник, а кто-то из основных ребят). Я был этому очень рад, терпеливо ждал, но периодически напоминал об этом 😄 В конце концов получил ответ и, можно сказать, завершил обучение на спираченном курсе. Не спешите убирать помидоры, есть еще. Я “немного” перфекционист, и мне не давало покоя, что я прошел “прошлогодний” курс, мне нужен был самый актуальный. И что я сделал? Пошел наставником в ту же академию с основной целью посмотреть актуальную программу. Я понимал, что какой-то опыт у меня уже есть, поэтому даже что-то новое пойму быстрее и смогу объяснить юному падавану. Но все же это плохо по оценкам моей совести, так как, в первую очередь, идти помогать нужно с идеей помогать не себе. В общем, прошел двухчасовое собеседование, и стал наставником с доступом к самому актуальному курсу. Вот такая история 🤷",3.0,,

Люди уходят быстро, поэтому нет смысла тратить деньги на их обучение. Поскольку компания ничего не вкладывает в человека, ему легко с нею распрощаться. Новых сотрудников нанимают не за их превосходные качества, поскольку заменить такие качества будет слишком сложно. Ощущение же, что компания не видит в сотруднике ничего необычайного, вызывает у этого сотрудника чувство неоцененности как индивидуума.

В сентябре этого года я почувствовала, что не получаю больше удовольствие от работы, хотя всей душой люблю маркетинг и рада, что когда-то попала в сферу неожиданно для себя. Я долго думала как вернуть ту искру и решила, что нужно освоить что-то новое. На прошлых проектах я много общалась с PMM (Product Marketing Manager) и мне нравился их функционал и пул задач. Далее идёт долгая история почему устроиться PMM в данный момент практически нереально (об этом как-нибудь напишу в другом посте). В итоге долго думая и просматривая рынок я смэтчила свои идеальные рабочие задачи с профессией product manager. Мне нравится заниматься продуктовыми метриками и в целом исследовать рынок. Как ни странно, именно с вакансиями на продакта у меня была наибольшая конверсия в отличии от PMM.В этом блоге я буду писать о том как я ищу работу, какие есть этапы и сложности.

https://t.me/Bychkow_Dmitrii",3.0,"Москва, Москва, Россия",64,"There are different types of servers that play important roles in managing and distributing data across networks. 🔥 Here are some basic server types and what they do: 💡 🌐 Origin Server: This server holds the original copy of a website or web application. When you access a website, your browser sends a request to the origin server, which then sends back the necessary files to display the site on your screen.🌐 Proxy Server: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a client and another server. It can help improve network performance by caching frequently accessed files and web pages, as well as filtering requests for security purposes.📧 Mail Server: This type of server manages the sending and receiving of email messages. When you send an email, your email client communicates with the mail server to deliver the message to the recipient's mail server.🌐 Web Server: A web server is a software program that delivers web content, such as HTML pages and images, to web browsers. It listens for incoming requests from clients and sends back the appropriate responses.🔍 DNS Server: A DNS server translates human-readable domain names (like ""google.com"") into IP addresses that computers can understand. When you type a URL into your browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address.✅ Understanding these basic server types can help you better navigate and troubleshoot network issues.

But did you know that this module provides a wide range of mathematical functions that can help simplify your code?The Math module in JavaScript provides methods for common mathematical operations like rounding, trigonometry, logarithms, and more. These functions can be useful in a variety of applications, from simple calculations to complex data analysis.Some of the most commonly used functions include:Math.round(): rounds a number to the nearest integerMath.random(): generates a random number between 0 and 1Math.max(): returns the highest value in a set of numbersMath.min(): returns the lowest value in a set of numbersMath.abs(): returns the absolute value of a numberMath.pow(): raises a number to a specified powerMath.sqrt(): returns the square root of a numberMath.sin(): returns the sine of an angleBy using these functions, you can make your code more efficient and concise. Plus, since the Math module is built into JavaScript, you don't need to install any external libraries to use it.So if you're a JavaScript developer looking to streamline your code and make it more mathematically sound, consider exploring the Math module.To learn more do visit W3Schools.comhttps://lnkd.in/dtKfgnE7#JavaScriptProgramming #JavaScriptDevelopers #MathFunctions #MathOperations #ProgrammingTips #WebDevelopment #CodeSimplicity #DataAnalysis #SoftwareDevelopment #ProgrammingLanguages #JavaScriptCode #JavaScriptSyntax #ProgrammingSkills #CodingCommunity #LearnToCode #CodeNewbie #CodingLife #TechTalk #CodeTips #DeveloperCommunity #CodeInspiration #JavaScriptTips #WebDeveloperTips #WebDesign #TechUpdates",7.0,1.0,5.0

https://t.me/Bychkow_Dmitrii",3.0,"Москва, Москва, Россия",64,"😱 Create React App RIP??? 😱 Зайдя на официальный сайт React я не сразу понял, что произошло.Когда мы заходим на страницу документации React в раздел установки, мы можем увидеть различные предложенные варианты установки фреймворков React, а именно Next.js, Remix, Expo, Gatsby. Но при этом нет варианта установки самого React в чистом виде. Неужели React сдает позиции.На самом деле это не так. Если присмотреться, то можно найти скрытую сноску с информацией о том, можно ли использовать React в чистом виде. Ниже я представлю перевод части данной сноски.Вы определенно можете использовать React без фреймворка. Однако, если вы создаете новое приложение или сайт полностью с помощью React, мы рекомендуем использовать платформу.И вот почему.Даже если сначала вам не нужна маршрутизация или получение данных (data fetching), вы, скорее всего, потом заходите добавить необходимые для них библиотеки. По мере роста вашего Javascript приложения растет ваш код и вам придется выяснять, как разнести этот код для каждого роута по отдельности. Во время увеличения потребностей в получении данных вероятно придется столкнуться с проблемами водопадом между сервером и клиентом (server-client network waterfalls), что замедлит ваше приложение. Поскольку большинство пользователей из аудитории имеет плохие условия сетевого соединения и недорогие устройства, вам понадобится создать HTML с ранним отображением компонентов - либо на сервере, либо во время сборки. Изменение настроек для выполнения части кода на сервере или во время сборки может быть сложным.. . . . . . .Фреймворки React на этой странице решают подобные проблемы по умолчанию, без дополнительной работы с вашей стороны. Они позволяют вам начать очень экономно, а затем масштабировать ваше приложение в соответствии с вашими потребностями.. . . . . . .Если вы все еще не уверены, или ваше приложение имеет необычные ограничения, которые плохо обслуживаются этими фреймворками, и вы хотите развернуть свою собственную пользовательскую настройку, мы не можем остановить вас — дерзайте! Берите react и react-dom из npm, настраивайте свой пользовательский процесс сборки с помощью сборщика, такого как Vite или Parcel, и добавляйте другие инструменты по мере необходимости для маршрутизации, статической генерации или рендеринга на стороне сервера и многого другого.Исходя из данной информации в принципе можно понять, что с React все в порядке. Просто разработчики говорят о том, что React - это библиотека, которая не имеет множества встроенных инструментов и лучше использовать какой-либо фреймворк, но при этом никто не перестает поддерживать и использовать React.#javascript #react #html #data #network",4.0,,2.0

Учимся выкупать и продавать б/у-товары на маркетплейсе. Нужна аналитика цен и ассортимента: эластичность цены выкупа/продажи, на сколько дороже объявлений на Авито можно поставить цену, куда целиться в ассортименте и мн. др.Что получите:- достойная з/п + премии за перфоманс- офигенные плюшки Яндекса: офисы, соцпакет, культура, талантливое коммьюнити- офис на Смоленской (Lotte Plaza) рядом с Арбатом- гибкий график, по сути его нет, главное ходить на нужные встречи и классно перфомить с аналитическими проектами- бесплатная парковка в офисах Яндекса (на минуточку, это: м. Фрунзенская, м. Смоленская, Москва Сити)- челенджовые задачки- увидите как ваши результаты меняют бизнес!Выбирайте кто вы сегодня и подавайтесь!

And before OpenAI rolls out the next release, which in addition to text, seems to be able to do pictures and video, I want to voice a thought about the expectations of large language models. Someone finds a lot of the most unexpected applications for them, and someone says ""chatGPT is a useless dumbass, doesn't know basic things, can't solve logical problems"". But if you take what chatGPT can do as the part of the human brain that is responsible for speech, then chatGPT is already doing just fine. You don't have to expect outstanding abilities in logic, factual knowledge, mathematics, spatial orientation, etc.  As I see it, in solving the problem of creating general artificial intelligence, some chatGPT analogue will act as a convenient speech interface between humans, and more specialized things - ""skills"", like a notional Matlab, a data warehouse or home robot. Its task is to maintain the dialogue, translating from human to internal language of the respective skill, and vice versa.",4.0,,

Лично мне эта история кажется гораздо более ценной, чем предыдущий хайп вокруг моделей text-to-image, и бесконечных картинок кенгуру в скафандре на Марсе. И первый вопрос, который я задал, был не ""The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"", а  ""Как измерить результаты работы аналитика данных?"": И вот что мне ответил ИИ:-------Существует несколько способов измерения результатов работы аналитика данных, в зависимости от конкретных целей и задач. Некоторые распространенные показатели для оценки работы аналитика данных включают:- Достоверность: степень, в которой выводы и рекомендации аналитика данных верны и подтверждаются данными.- Точность: степень, в которой выводы и рекомендации аналитика данных являются конкретными и четко определенными.- Своевременность: степень, в которой аналитик данных способен своевременно предоставлять свои результаты, соблюдая крайние сроки и предоставляя регулярные обновления по мере необходимости.- Актуальность: степень, в которой выводы и рекомендации аналитика данных актуальны и применимы к рассматриваемой проблеме.- Коммуникация: способность аналитика данных эффективно сообщать о своих выводах и рекомендациях другим, включая нетехнические заинтересованные стороны.В целом, успех работы аналитика данных можно измерить по его влиянию на организацию и его способности помогать в принятии решений и разработке бизнес-стратегии.--------Если это не прямая цитата из какой-то публикации, то звучит очень даже адекватно, и я, пожалуй, не встречал более удачного ответа на мой вопрос.",3.0,2.0,1.0

Well actually, you don't need to imagine, you can just use it! Introducing RIFFUSION, a Stable Diffusion model trained on Spectrogram image data: https://lnkd.in/ge9_VE6t. The idea is simplistic: - just pick a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model (https://lnkd.in/dpFheWYS)- Take lot of musics with their text descriptions and convert that into Spectrogram image data- Fine-tune to the Stable Diffusion model=> you now have a model that can predict new spectrograms based on other spectrograms or text prompts. Just convert those spectrograms back to musics.  If you want more details on how to do it yourself you can follow the process here: https://lnkd.in/gpj_K-UF. I discovered this website yesterday through Alpha Signal's weekly summary: https://alphasignal.ai/.

Я сертифицированный менеджер проектов PMP.Я пишу программное обеспечение около 14 лет, 3 из которых были посвящены веб-разработке. В настоящее время я работаю как над внутренним, так и над внешним интерфейсом.

Обычно я разрабатываю веб-приложения на фреймворках React, Redux, Webpack, Next.js. Моя экосистема React.js включает в себя: Redux для управления состоянием, повторный выбор для повышения производительности, пакет response-redux для оптимизации производительности, response-router для маршрутизации, использование приложения create-response-app для быстрого запуска проекта, response-dnd для добавления Drag-и -Функция Drop в веб-приложении, веб-пакете для создания проекта и производительности приложения с разделением кода.

Мои знания React.js основаны на опыте работы с интерфейсными технологиями, такими как JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS. Я использую новейшие инструменты веб-разработки.

Среди моих достижений - завершение и участие во многих проектах, которые включали фронтенд-разработку, в том числе разработку веб-приложения для финансовой торговли, участие в разработке таких веб-приложений, как финансовая биржа, приложение для администрирования пользователей и устройств, веб-приложение для путешествий и другие.

Я пишу современный модульный код, который соответствует принципам масштабируемости, ремонтопригодности, работает в разных браузерах и создает удобство для пользователей.

Я могу писать серверные приложения на Python, используя Django, DjangoREST, Flask и Node.js, используя Express. Для асинхронных очередей предпочитаю сельдерей, но также есть опыт работы с RabbitMQ. Работает со следующими базами данных PostgreSQL, Redis, mysql, MongoDB. Отличное знание языка запросов SQL.

Kickico project was hacked on July 27, to be precise owning key of KICK coin smart contract was stolen and some tokens were burnt. Kickico project recovered access and promises to restore stolen/burnt tokens. Interesting token contract and very lucky guys. Really interesting thing starts next. Exmo.me crypto exchange also suffered a loss of KICK coins. And they started to lay their hands on KICK deposits which were sent *after* the hack, i.e. on coins which were perfectly safe. The scheme is the following: you send deposit, it is confirmed in Ethereum network, but you won't see it in your exmo wallet. Support is making excuses about technical maintenance (10 days of maintenance? C'mon), but I know that tokens were safe before transacting to exmo and don't need any maintenance. The likely root of the issue is that they're trying to cover (maybe temporal) expenses at the expense of users.The bottom line is that if you're using exmo - consider more trusted exchange, otherwise you're exposing yourself to a high risk of theft or funds blocking.#blockchain #scam #exmo",,,

There are 4 ways, no matter whether you’re using PayPal, Stripe, Paytm, WeChat, or Alipay. Is this surprising to you? To understand this, we will answer to questions. The first question is who presents the QR code:1. You can present the QR code and the merchant scans the code for payment. This is called ‘consumer-presented mode, and what the merchant does is direct debit your account.2. Obviously, the other way is that the merchant presents the QR code for you to scan to pay the due amount. This is called ‘merchant-presented mode’ and you grant the direct credit from your account.The second question is whether the QR code is dynamic or static:1. A dynamic QR code means the QR code will be generated when you present it, or it will automatically regenerate every few seconds. Because it is dynamically generated, it may contain rich information, such as the amount due, transaction type, etc.2. A static QR code is generated once and used everywhere. Usually, it only contains the account information. So there are 2*2=4 ways to scan a QR code, which are:1. Consumer-presented mode + static QR code2. Consumer-presented mode + dynamic QR code3. Merchant-presented mode + static QR code4. Merchant-presented mode + dynamic QR codeI’ve created an image to illustrate these 4 cases and their classic scenarios. 👉 Over to you: I’ve marked one of the scan-to-pay scenarios with a red alert symbol to indicate that a risk is present. Do you know why it is high risk? —Join a growing community of more than 100,000 readers who love System Design.

Решил походить по собесам, и увидел предложение от https://lnkd.in/dNqZQreG ИП Ковальчук А.А. Что же в нем необычного?⚫ Начнем с собеса - мне скинули ссылку на Зум сессию, где кроме меня еще было 9 человек. В начале я подумал, что меня сразу взяли и будут знакомить с командой. Я начал писать в ЛС Наталье (это HR)(далее Н) по поводу всего, но я смог получить ответ только с третьего раза. Да, Н не понимала вопросов, которые я спрашивал по-поводу сессии. В итоге оказалось, что это был руководитель Александр Ковальчук (далее А) и 8 кандидатов на позицию QA⚫ Как проходил сам собес? Каждый по очереди рассказывал о себе вкратце (у всех +- был опыт пол года (кроме меня)), затем А исключал неуместных кандидатов по типу ""Извините, но вы слабенький"", а оставшимся (в том числе и мне) предложил написать всю тест док-цию на одну из фичей своего проекта. Мне попался логин + CRUD онлайн курсов. Нам дали на это неделю и попрощались. Сам фунционал максимальной тривиальный и я выполнил задание в тот же день ⚫ Что было после? Я начал задавать вопросы Н по поводу видов услуг, где находится их офис, удаленки, моих обязанностой, про проект и т.д, но Н меня посылала к А (а он игнорит эти вопросы). Ибо в вакансии указаны были Брест и Гродно (дубли вакансий), но на деле они в Варшаве, и вам пришлось бы стать самозанятым или открыть ИПЧерез пару дней мне написала Н с предложением о созвоне в Зуме вместе с А. Я подумал, что выбрали меня. ⚫ О чем созвон? А начал с того, что предложил тестовый период в виде 80 часов и пониженной ЗП (что логично), НО самое интересное начинается тут - контракт или какой-либо договор НЕ будет заключаться ДО окончания тестового⚫ Как будет проходить сам тестовый период? Мне А в ТГ будет скидывать креды и таски, чтобы проверять мои скиллы и понять, ли сможет со мной работать. На вопросы про дев команду, процессам, нагрузке, обязанностям и т.д А отвечал типа так - ""В начале я должен для себя понять, ли мы сможем сотрудничать и понять твои скиллы"". По сути, А сам не понимает, что от меня хочет, но хочет чтобы я работал. Для интереса я согласился, хотя уже понимал, что ни на какую ЗП рассчитывать не стоитЯ проработал 16 часов (нагрузки не было). Проектов было 3, они +- схожи по функционалу, просто под разные рынки После я предложил созвониться и все таки получить ответы, но к этому моменту А уже трусливо удалил переписку в ТГБыла ли выплачена хоть какая-то сумма? Конечно нет🙃 ⚫ Что по задачам? По типу ""Напиши доки на все, а наш дизайнер (да да, UI/UX дизайнер) тебя проверит"", ""протестируй весь сайт и напиши отчет"" и подобное. Возможно, этот пост как-то поможет Джунам, Трейни в сфере QA не попасться на удочку таких ""разводил"". В чем суть их развода? Все просто - месяц поработаете вы, месяц другой человек и далее. Новичков и людей готовых работать на таких условиях туча, так что проекты будут живыПоделюсь их данными:ТГ: @AlexKowal и @Nata_ili",8.0,7.0,2.0

Сразу оговорюсь, эти мысли понравятся ни всем белорусам, ни всем русским и уж тем более не всем украинцам. И ещё один нюанс заранее предупреждаю что не все эти мысли моего авторства, но проверяя и сопоставляя факты прихожу к выводу что так оно и есть. Пост я назову МЫ ВСЕ ВИНОВАТЫ. И пожалуй раз уж я белорус начну с нас.  Мы ребята виноваты. Не потому что мы плохая нация или агрессивная, какой многие нас считают, но мы виноваты. Виноваты рабочие тракторного которые услышав о том что ""новые выборы будут только после моей смерти"" не устроили новые выборы. Виноваты учителя подтасовывавшие голоса на выборах. Виновата милиция избивавшая мирных безоружных граждан. Виноваты военные стрелявшие у убивавшие людей. Виноваты рабочие и айтишники не устроившие забастовку. Виноваты мы все в какой то мере. Какими бы жертвами мы себя не чувствовали.Россияне тоже виноваты. Виноваты потому что разрознены и не могут сплотиться как нация. Виноваты в том что как и мы терпят своего диктатора имея более вспыльчивый менталитет. Виноваты в нападении на Украину. Виноваты в том что Россия поддерживала Беларусь после событий 20го года пока наших людей пытали на Окрестино и не смогли ничего сделать для того чтобы не спонсировался кровавый режим.Украинцы тоже виноваты. Виноваты в том что пару лет назад обожали нашего диктатора а теперь переобулись и винят всю нацию. Виноваты как и Россияне в покупке электроэнергии битума и нефти у режима. Виноваты что всегда западная Украина ненавидела русских.Это лишь малая толика фактов которая каждого жителя наших стран делает немного хуже, чем он о себе думает.

Знаете дорогие друзья, моя команда сейчас состоит полность из жителей Украины, Беларуси и России. И не смотря на то что сейчас творится в мире внутри моей команды нет никакой вражды и презрения. Наоборот только поддержка как ребятам из Украины так и из России. На мой взгляд люди делятся только на 2 типа: адекватных и те кто пытается кого то в чем то обвинить. Я хочу сказать что адекватные люди не враги друг другу. И мы не виноваты что политики которых ни одна из так называемых стран агрессоров не поддерживает развязали эту войну. По мере наших сил каждый из нас делает что может. Кто то донатит деньги, кто то из РБ идёт воевать за Украину. Я веду к тому, что нам всем стоит оставаться людьми и не делить мир на чёрное и белое.

Знаю что у меня в контактах много начинающих QA, которым было бы интересно прочесть про Apache Jmeter, и как его использовать для простого нагрузочного/стресс тестирования на реальном примере.В прошлом я работал с трафиком, а значит вопрос устойчивости серверов стоял очень остро. Трафик не останавливался ни на минуту, а упавший сервер в 12 часов ночи и обнаруженный в таком состоянии в 10 утра вёл к слитому впустую бюджету, падению ROI и зарплаты. Нужен был инструмент для замеров и анализа, и это Jmeter.Для нашей задачи нам нужны простые функции: Создать Thread Group, добавить HTTP request, и способы отображения статистики: Summary Report, Result Tree и тд.Для того чтобы проверить как сервер справляется с простой посещаемостью сайта нам потребуется GET request и ссылка на страницу. Самое важное в настройке - разобраться с Thread Group. Благодаря настройке параметров этого меню нагрузочное тестирование может превратиться в стресс-тестирование, а неаккуратные действия привести вас в чат тех.поддержки сервер-хостера. Особенно ""весело"" будет если сервер не Ваш, а компании, и на нем хостится продукт.•Number of Threads - кол-во ""юзеров"", атакующих наш ресурс.•Ramp-UP period - Время, затраченное на то, чтобы Jmeter запустил заданное кол-во юзеров.•Loop-Count - кол-во выполненных запросов юзером. На основании этих настроек получаются различные типы тестирования:✅ Stress Testing: Threads - 1000, Ramp-up - 2, Loop-Count - 3. Jmeter отправит 3000 запросов за 2 секунды, что почти наверняка положит сервер. Но.. разве не это мы и собирались проверить? Конечно начинать с таких цифр не стоит, от информации что сервер упал при 3000 запросах пользы мало. Лучше начать с 5 запросов и дойти до того уровня, где сервер уже не выдерживает. ✅Load Testing: Threads - 30, Ramp-up - 60, Loop-Count - Infinite. Jmeter достигнет заданного кол-ва одновременной постоянной отправки запросов через 60 секунд. Если мы знаем, что наш ресурс в пиковые часы нагрузки посещает 30 человек - этот тест покажет как ведет себя сервер при такой нагрузке.✅Performance Testing: Увеличиваем значение кол-ва потоков, этим тестом мы проверяем как поведет себя сервер при нетипично большой нагрузке, к примеру втрое больше стандартной пиковой.✅Recoverability Testing: Если уже положили сервер, почему бы не проверить как скоро он поднимется, и что будет с данными.На моем сервере, я выяснил следующее:При 200 одновременных потоков с Ramp-up 2 секунды и бесконечным циклом, сервер грузится на 205%, но не падает, однако это слишком большая нагрузка и долго её держать не стоит.При 80 потоках с Ramp-up 60 секунд и бесконечным циклом, сервер неплохо держится на уровне около 100% загрузки, при этом в первые секунды начала теста время отклика 300 мс, затем растет к 1600, что достаточно много.При 20-30 потоках выдается примерно стандартные значения загрузки для сервера. Всем спасибо за проявленный интерес, репост коллегам QA если показалось полезным!  #qa #testing #jmeter",9.0,4.0,8.0

Be efficient.5) Ditch frequent meetingsThere’s no better way to waste everyone’s time.Use meetings to:- Collaborate- Attack issues head-on- Solve urgent problemsBut once you resolve the issue, frequent meetings are no longer necessary.You can resolve most issues without a meeting.Instead of meetings:- Send a text- Send an email- Communicate on a discord or slack channelDon’t interrupt your team’s workflow if it’s unnecessary.6) Use common senseIf a company rule doesn’t:- Make sense- Contribute to progress- Apply to your specific situationAvoid following the rule with your eyes closed.Don’t follow rules.

No matter how reasonable they are.You messed.Maybe you failed. Maybe you lost everything.Yes, accept it, learn from it, and don't live in it.Never do it again.3. Learn some skills for funSome skills like 👇√ Cooking √ Sharpening knives and axes√ Driving √ Swimming √ Sewing √ Calculated silence They may not be for monetary purposes but you should learn them4. Learn Self-defence Self-defense is important.Not because you can fight anyone. But for yourself, family and moments you can't avoid.You also become more confident and disciplined.5. Always tell the truth or stay calm.Because there is nothing as shameful as being known as a liarYou may get what you want But it won't last longNo one will ever believe you when it matters6.

Нужно ломиться в каждую открытую и не очень дверь, заявлять о себе рекрутерам, по возможности знакомится с людьми со схожей деятельностью.

Я ищу постоянную работу уже почти 5 месяцев и дела в этом плане продвигаются очень медленно. За это время я научилась составлять резюме, писать сопроводительные, освоила Unittest, Arsenic, Flask, MongoDB, Docker и Linux, стала гораздо сильнее как программист и начала брать заказы на фрилансе (небольшие, но какие давали).Почему это стало так важно именно сейчас? Мои сбережения подходят к концу, а от моего дохода завишу не только я, но и моих близких человека 3 человека, 2 из которых не могут работать из-за возраста и проблем со здоровьем.Что я умею и могу?Пишу на языке программирования Python, работаю в основном с SQL базами данных и фреймворком Django, но так же знаю и MongoDB и Flask. Сейчас, в основном специализируюсь на разработке Web приложений.Умею парсить с помощью BS4 (обычный/асинхронный), Selenium и Arsenic (асинхронный вариант Selenium).Умею писать ботов для Telegram.Знаю контейнеризацию Docker и как прокладывать сети на Linux.Освоила тестирование с помощью Unittest и TestCaseЧто я ищу?Постоянную работу в Минске или удаленно, или длительный фриланс заказ. Я пунктуальна, исполнительна, поддерживаю связь с заказчиком и регулярно даю информацию по проекту, а так же не пропадаю из контактов и не игнорирую сообщения. Изучаю деплой, английский на стыке A2/B1 сейчас активно развиваю разговорный английский, что бы довести его до уровня B1.CV на русском: https://lnkd.in/eUpcWDdxЕсли у вас есть для меня предложение, прошу написать в личные сообщения или через контакты из CV.

Более сотни откликов на вакансии и полная тишина в ответ. За это время я выполнил только два тестовых задания и даже по ним, к сожалению, не получил обратной связи. Чтобы зря время не терять, я решил поучаствовать в спринт-марафоне по frontend от Clevertec. Темой проекта стало создание онлайн-библиотеки, это по сути аналог классических библиотечных формуляров, т.е. позволяет ознакомиться со всем списком доступных книг, забронировать понравившуюся книгу или отследить, когда наоборот освободится бронь по книге.Пока подводить итоги рано (еще не дошли до середины пути), но с того момента как дали API (первых два этапа больше касались верстки по макету из Figma), какой-то промежуточный результат показать уже могу.

Он основан на искусственном интеллекте и использует машинное обучение, чтобы предлагать подсказки и автозаполнение кода на основе контекста и задачи, которую разработчик пытается решить.Одним из ключевых отличий между Copilot и ChatGPT является то, что Copilot специализируется на работе с кодом, в то время как ChatGPT разработан для ответа на разнообразные вопросы и задачи, включая общение с людьми на естественном языке.Кроме того, Copilot использует модель обучения с подкреплением, чтобы автоматически уточнять свои предложения и учитывать обратную связь от разработчика. ChatGPT, с другой стороны, использует модель языкового моделирования для генерации текстовых ответов.Copilot также обладает способностью к контекстному пониманию и может использовать контекст кода, чтобы предлагать более точные предложения и подсказки для написания нового кода.В целом, Copilot облегчает жизнь разработчиков, ускоряя процесс написания кода и помогая избежать ошибок, что в конечном итоге увеличивает производительность и эффективность.ChatGPT в качестве языковой модели также может использоваться для рефакторинга больших блоков кода. Например, он может помочь разработчикам переписать сложный блок кода более эффективным способом или найти оптимальное решение для определенной задачи.#copilot #chatgpt",3.0,,

https://portfolio-cv-eight.vercel.app/",2.0,"Калуга, Калужская область, Россия",3,"Vite - это инструмент сборки (bundler) для веб-разработки, который был создан, чтобы облегчить и ускорить процесс разработки веб-приложений. Vite - это сокращение от французского слова ""vite"" (что означает ""быстро"" или ""быстрый""), что отражает основную философию этого инструмента.Одной из основных особенностей Vite является его скорость. Он быстро пересобирает приложение и быстро отображает изменения в браузере благодаря сборке на лету (on-demand compilation) и кэшированию результатов. В результате разработчики могут быстро прототипировать свои приложения и получить быструю обратную связь на этапе разработки.Одна из других ключевых особенностей Vite - это его поддержка для модулей ES6, что позволяет разработчикам использовать современные возможности языка JavaScript без необходимости использовать сборщики типа Babel для транспиляции кода в более старые версии языка.Vite также предоставляет возможность использовать различные языки и фреймворки, такие как Vue, React и другие.По сравнению с Webpack, Vite является более легковесным и быстрым. Vite использует более простую и интуитивную конфигурацию, что упрощает процесс настройки и использования. Однако, Webpack более гибок и имеет больший набор функциональности, что делает его более подходящим для более сложных проектов.По сравнению с Gulp, Vite - это не просто задачник (task runner), а полноценный инструмент сборки (bundler), который позволяет собирать и объединять модули и зависимости вашего приложения в один файл. Gulp не является бандлером, а скорее предназначен для автоматизации процесса сборки проектов, таких как компиляция препроцессоров CSS и минификация файлов.В целом, Vite является быстрым и интуитивно понятным инструментом сборки, который лучше подходит для простых и средних проектов. Он обеспечивает быстрое время сборки, поддержку современных языков и фреймворков, а также простую и понятную конфигурацию.#vite #webpack #gulp",1.0,,

New loss function.Online advertising , Real time bidding.In general there are two task in real time bidding.First is a task of optimizing requests choice, second is a optimizing bid prices.A first task answers on a question , what need to buy, to get a revenue.The revenue is get from the target events: Clicks, Conversions …So we may make a model that predict the events. It’s a classification task and may be solve as usual classification problem of binary classification.A second task answers on a question , what price need, to get a more benefit and win an auction .I consider the second task.The second is more complex, need increase number of win bids. Because only a wining bid gives revenue.The trivial solution is to set a bid price little smaller then an expected benefit, for example smaller by 10 % . But this solution is not optimal when there is a limit of our budget, and limits our benefit with 10%.Not bad solution is predict a probability of win and if the probability smaller then a given value increase a bid price. It’s a classification task too.But there is another way. Lets try to find an optimal price of the bid that layers between the loss price and win price, said for the same requests. And then if the win probability for this bid price smaller then some value, we increase the bid price.At first glance, this is a regression problem. But there is one problem. We only know the cost of losing when we lose the auction, but we don't know the next win price. In another case, we know the winning price when we won the auction, but we do not know the price of the next loss.And in general the bid price is a function of an input request. That is a set of categorical and numerical values.Such as : exchange id, app id, city, hour, day of week, language , and so on.Our model need to predict an optimal price for each request.My approach is to use a custom loss function that solves the problem. (I called loss YuLoss.)The loss function is based with MSE loss with little changes, or may base with any other regression loss.The main idea is :If the prediction price less or equivale then the loss price we penalty our model.If the prediction price more then the loss price we don’t penalty our model with MSE loss.If the prediction price less or equavile then the win price we don’t penalty our model.If the prediction price more then the win price we penalty our model with MSE loss.MSE (target, prediction) , if prediction <= target and result == no win else 0YuLoss =MSE (target, prediction), if prediction > target and result == win else 0The Model was made with using Catboost lib:Inputs: a list of vectors of categorical features.Targets : a list of prices and results - win/ no win.Data set of 10 M rows.The solution has given the optimal prices that in sum less then initial prices on 70 %.By the way a win rate decrease only 5%.The experiment was made with A\ B test.",1.0,,

For me, description models like classification/segmentation/embedding ones seem fine.But the CLIP model is also descriptive, you can't reproduce images easily from this. SD used a pre-trained and freezed CLIP model, and CLIP itself seems as fair use.But even if you use just CLIP and optimize in pixel space you may reproduce Getty watermark or some artist style (vqvae+clip or disco diffusion or even old deep dream algo). And SD itself generates some styles not only because it used them during the training, but also because CLIP pretraining knows them already. So if CLIP is also not fair use we should start suing OpenAI.But CLIP is a ""descriptive"" model, so should we change the ""fair use"" of other descriptive models (like classification/segmentation/etc.), and how we can prove that smth was used and that model in pipeline influence someones ""style"" (CLIP or SD)?So no we can either ban all the ""fair use"" or not change it at all.",,,

Just the opposite. It will damage your prospects. If you’re in a postdoc now, please don’t rationalize staying longer by telling yourself you have time to decide what to do next, or that your postdoc is somehow adding valuable experience. Top companies don’t want PhDs to gain even more academic experience. They want you to gain on the job training. And they want you to start now. I hate seeing PhDs chase low paying postdocs for years only to have it used against them when they finally realize they won’t ever be a tenured professor - or worse, they become tenured and quickly as “This is it? I have to do the work of 10 people for half of what I would make in industry?” If you want to stay in a postdoc - that, of course, is up to you.

Такие посты в ленте напомнили несколько случаев запущенной агорафобии, которые наблюдал ещё с тех времен, когда дистанционная работа не была мэнстримом. В трёх случаях из четырёх она постепенно развивалась от точки относительного благополучия. Кто-то был уволен с небольшим ""серебряным парашютиком"", кто-то получил скромное наследство, у кого-то была план расширения квартиры и продав большую жилплощадь он дожидался более удачной конъюнктуры съехав в маленькую квартирку или родителям. Эти 3/4 были характерны только для наблюдавшихся мужчин, женщины впадали в такое состояние после глубокой психологической травмы или болезни. Из всех женщин в моём окружении был только один случай, когда ситуация дошла до полного краха личности, через прогрессирующую психосоматику и манипулирование вторичной выгодой.   Поэтому дальше я говорю только о мужчинах. Первый шаг к разрушению был в сознательном отказе от текущей работы или специальности. Небольшие деньги позволяли выскочить из ежедневной гонки, уволится с места ради ""новой карьерной возможности"" или ""поиска себя"". На втором шаге происходило обеднении социальных связей. ""Выскочившие"" не были ни алкоголиками, ни наркоманами, у них не было ни каких увлечений или хобби, они никогда не занимались профессиональным спортом, кто-то даже самохарактеризовало себя как ""нарцисcических социофобов"". Поэтому у них абсолютно не было опыта ""вне рабочих"" коммуникаций. Они тихо сидели дома, читали книги, строили какие-то планы и занимались домашними делами, постепенно переставая думать о том, как они выглядят со стороны. Первым признаком ""спирали"" была легкая, одно-двухнедельная щетина и всклокоченные, месяцами нестриженые волосы.И вот здесь самую отвратительную роль начинали играть родственники и близкие люди.Сначала они принимали всё как ""временное явление"", до новой работы, потом - как часть обычной жизни: ""Он же всё делает по дому, не пьет, не колется, деньги не таскает, баб - не водит. Лишних расходов с меня - пачка хороших сигарет в день и бутылка пива по субботам. Могу себе позволить. Всё нормально!"". И в финале, когда становилось понятно, что человек годами не выходит из дома и ни с кем вне семьи не разговаривает и нет денег: ""Так получилось. Сказали, что можно оформить ему ""инвалидность"", но ведь его никуда не вытащишь, а денег на такси у нас нет"". Кончалось всё по абсолютно банальным причинам: скатывание в гиподинамию, сердечная недостаточность, флебит, ампутации и ранняя смерть.Вытащить из такого состояния человека очень сложно. И прежде всего потому, что он долгое время вызревает в комфортном ""коконе"" заботы родственников, не считающих это состояние чем-то из ряда вон, не требующим стороннего вмешательства или финансовых затрат.  #работа #metaverse #агорафобия",4.0,7.0,1.0

Уж если ранжирование сделало из никому неизвестной GPT-3 Chat-GPT, то и тебе пригодится) Также множество полезных знаний для построения поисковых систем.2) Ценообразование - модуль достаточно специфичекский, на приактике не применял, в целом неплохо.3) А/Б - это уже мой третий курс по аб, и как у предыдущих, если не делаешь тесты на работе, то все забывается через месяц. В курсе упор сделан, на подготовку тестов. Меня удивило сколько разнообразных соломок можно подстелить до начала теста, плюс техники снижения дисперсии - куча новой и полезной информации. Задания немного странные - нельзя переиспользовать код в финальном проекте, но можно брать код с семинаров.4) Uplift - также как ЦО достаточно специфический курс, но мне очень понравилась компановка модуля - в финальном проекте надо просто собрать код предыдущих ДЗ.5) Deploy - супер сложный модуль (если делать фин проект с кодом), потратил на него гораздо больше времени, чем на ранжирование, но и пользы от него больше. Дается представление о многих фундаментальных вещах: как мастбируются сервисы, почему не надо ставить model.predict() под async и другие инженерные штуки. Очень часто использую в работе, и в целом уверенее себя чувствуешь на систем дизайнах с коллегами и девопсами.В двух словах про сам курс: поддержка отвечает долго и туманно. Сначало это раздражает, но потом адаптируешься и закладываешь время на общение с поддержкой в ДЗ. С какого-то момента стал относится к этому как к части курса, а не к припятствию на пути его прохождения. Типо это бихэйв интервью с вопросами: Strong Disagreement, Production Outage и т.д) Иногда правильный код не отрабатывает на грейдере, и нужно доказать это поддержке - также относиться к предыдущему пункту. В таких случаях, кстати, отмечу адекватность поддержки - любой вопрос можно решить.P.S курс я закончил еще в январе, но все не доходили руки написать пост, возможно уже поменялось",8.0,6.0,1.0
